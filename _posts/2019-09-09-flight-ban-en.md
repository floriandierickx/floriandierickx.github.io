Proposals of 23 October 2017 [<a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/Q0Cg7OEDSX]" target="_blank">https://t.co/Q0Cg7OEDSX]</a> by <span class="tweet-mention">@JorisVDBroucke</span>, Bruno Tobback <span class="tweet-mention">@sp_a</span> and <span class="tweet-mention">@JohanDanen</span> <span class="tweet-mention">@groen</span> and 4 july 2018 [<a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/n3zByehSz1]" target="_blank">https://t.co/n3zByehSz1]</a> <span class="tweet-mention">@JorisVDBroucke</span> <span class="tweet-mention">@IngridPira1</span> <span class="tweet-mention">@NadiaSminate</span>
<span class="tweet-mention">@ward_kennes</span>, pointing at ðŸ‘‡

- responsibility of aviation for +- 5 % of emissions
- only 2-8 % of external "costs" are internalized for short and long distance flights
- no measures taken on EU or international level to reduce emissions
- EU ETS does not apply
- flights 20 times more impact than flights
- international market mechanism under negotiation and at the earliest applied by 2027
- European and international legislation will not be sufficient to get to Paris goals
- Flemish government <span class="tweet-mention">@vlaamseoverheid</span> uses +- 5 flights per day, frequently international flights
- Flemish government employees frequently fly to cities which can be accessed by train
- there are no initiatives to compensate flight emissions at governmental level
- the Flemish Climate Resolution points out that the Flemish Government wants to lead by example

Therefore calling for ðŸ‘‡

Leading by example, by:

- reduce emissions by prioritizing modern communication technologies
- systematically choose for train travel for destinations that can be reached in less than 6 hours / 500 km
- developing a compensation mechanism

Resolution approved unanimously on 4 July 2018 in parliament <span class="tweet-mention">@vlaparl</span> [<a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/8qWAdIi1WG]" target="_blank">https://t.co/8qWAdIi1WG]</a>

Follow-up in March 2019 [<a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/cLTO1Efw5l]" target="_blank">https://t.co/cLTO1Efw5l]</a> : air travel of public servants [<a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/Usfnlpc9Sk]" target="_blank">https://t.co/Usfnlpc9Sk]</a> and ministers [<a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/Usfnlpc9Sk]," target="_blank">https://t.co/Usfnlpc9Sk],</a> indicating cost and distance.

<span class="tweet-mention">@vlaparl</span> Some of the solutions to extend this to the private sector + citizens :

- More subsidies for trains and more taxation for air travel, so trains become the default cheapest option
- More night trains, as being discussed for example in Switzerland <a class="tweet-lnk" href="https://t.co/r1dGGBMgD1" target="_blank">https://t.co/r1dGGBMgD1</a>
