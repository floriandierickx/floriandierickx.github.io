"The economics of renewables are impossible for oil to compete with when looked at over the cycle. We calculate that to get the same amount of mobility from gasoline as from new renewables with EVs over the next 25 years would cost 6.2-7x more"

"even if we add in the cost of building new network infrastructure to cope with all the new wind and/or solar capacity  implied  by  replacing  gasoline  with  renewables  and  EVs,  the  economics  of  renewables  still  crush those of oil"
