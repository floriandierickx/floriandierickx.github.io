"Legal experts from <span class="tweet-mention">@ClientEarth</span>, an international non-profit organization in the field of environmental law, are calling on governments worldwide to reduce this risk.Investor-state arbitrage could prevent climate measures such as phasing out fossils or introducing a CO2 tax."

"<span class="tweet-hashtag">#ISDS</span> provisions are included in around 3000 agreements worldwide. They mean that investing companies, if hindered in their business operations, can demand compensation from the government.

This also applies to social and environmental policies that can affect investments."

"In a letter to the UN Commission on International Trade Law (#UNCITRAL) that deals with reform of the ISDS system [http://bit.ly/2JMqVO1](http://bit.ly/2JMqVO1) @KylaTienhaara
], legal experts warn that foreign investors may use ISDS to delay the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement"

“The ISDS system has led to an alarming number of claims against environmental measures. This is now the fastest growing type of claims. They pose a threat to the global fight against climate change" Amandine Van den Berghe <span class="tweet-mention">@ClientEarth</span>

"Among other things, the legal experts recommend developing a mechanism that will allow countries to evade traditional investment treaties and ISDS."

# Risks posed by ISDS to the global fight against climate change 

@ClientEarth @KylaTienhaara article [http://bit.ly/32NA5RV](http://bit.ly/32NA5RV)

[1] Estimated 1 to 4 trillion worth of assets in the energy sector that may become stranded by 2050 [https://t.co/Eo3ZzM6Zx7](https://t.co/Eo3ZzM6Zx7)

[2] Cost of compensation and only participating in legal cases in the context of ISDS's increases the cost of the energy transition and can be very high for governments in developing countries [https://t.co/T0OHGjfIcO](https://t.co/T0OHGjfIcO)

[3] Growing body of evidence of "regulatory chill" effect of ISDS on policy, ex:

<span class="tweet-mention">@VermilionEnergy</span> threatened to sue France under ISDS in 2017 if it pushed ahead with the law to phase-out fossil fuel extraction in all French territories drafted by <span class="tweet-mention">@Min_Ecologie</span> (<span class="tweet-mention">@corporateeurope</span>)

[4] Risk of ISDS acute for developing countries :

Majority of claims are brought by investors from high-income  countries  (86.25%) against  upper–middle-income  (42.15%)  and  lower–middle-income (24.26%) countries [http://bit.ly/2Y1fV8c](http://bit.ly/2Y1fV8c) from [https://t.co/VsENh54RCb?amp=1](https://t.co/VsENh54RCb?amp=1) : [https://t.co/FtE4zsT6yY](https://t.co/FtE4zsT6yY)

# Phase 3 of UNCITRAL WG III : Consistency with international obligations

"discussions have failed to address the potential for inconsistency between ISDS and broader societal objectives found in other areas of domestic/international law" [https://t.co/CQL91yVRxl](https://t.co/CQL91yVRxl)

# Options to address the negative impacts of ISDS on climate change policy

## [1] Terminating investment treaties / moving away from ISDS

"WGIII should develop a mech. to allow countries to easily move away from traditional investment treaties and ISDS" [https://t.co/G7I0moBav9](https://t.co/G7I0moBav9)

Termination sounds radical, but already occurring [ https://hyp.is/q6cKJK1UEemq0edCZQ9zKw/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf](https://hyp.is/q6cKJK1UEemq0edCZQ9zKw/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf):

* Indonesia, India, and South Africa overhauled ISDS
* New Zealand and Brazil policy not to include ISDS
* New Canada / US treaty removed ISDS

107 ISDS have been terminated and not replaced recently [https://t.co/TyqA11VAK5](https://t.co/TyqA11VAK5)

## [2] Adopting legal toolbox...

...so that only responsible investors who respect international climate commitments can utilize ISDS [https://hyp.is/_jG5Lq1UEemtPJdTNQIlRQ/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf](https://hyp.is/_jG5Lq1UEemtPJdTNQIlRQ/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf)

to:

### {a} Carve-out government measures taken in pursuit of international obligations under the Paris Agreement

[https://t.co/a06qu8hcJk](https://t.co/a06qu8hcJk)

"Dismissal  of  any  claim  that  challenges  climate  mit./adapt.,  as  determined  by  an  independent  panel  of  climate  change  experts" (link: http://bit.ly/2M8JWvI) bit.ly/2M8JWvI

### {b} Require exhaustion of local remedies

[https://hyp.is/aJM6mq1VEemaGCMWA8R8ug/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf](https://hyp.is/aJM6mq1VEemaGCMWA8R8ug/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf)

= resorting to domestic courts first [https://t.co/DLe0mKtcb2]

### {c} Allow counterclaims and ensure full participation for affected third parties

[https://hyp.is/1FxNwK1VEemTUAcI8oy02g/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf](https://hyp.is/1FxNwK1VEemTUAcI8oy02g/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf)

"rulings such as these are not the norm: counterclaims are generally unsuccessful in the absence of explicit language in the applicable investment treaty" [https://t.co/yywDdp9noZ](https://t.co/yywDdp9noZ)

### {d} Ban third-party funding

[https://hyp.is/VpAm9K1WEem46P-Vp2EYhA/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf](https://hyp.is/VpAm9K1WEem46P-Vp2EYhA/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf)

"third-party financing is an emerging trend, although it remains difficult to estimate the exact scale of itin ISDS given the lack of rules around disclosure" [https://t.co/VCypWD4UU8](https://t.co/VCypWD4UU8)

### {e} Include climate change impacts in the calculation method for compensation

[https://hyp.is/dV4wEq1WEem3IvfRmp4atA/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf](https://hyp.is/dV4wEq1WEem3IvfRmp4atA/www.documents.clientearth.org/wp-content/uploads/library/2019-july-clientearth-uncitral-aligning-phase-3-with-ciimate-change-efforts2.pdf)

Currently notion of “fair market value”, but: "may be inappropriate or unjust" [https://t.co/aXfz4uAPhT](https://t.co/aXfz4uAPhT)

Example: current debate in <span class="tweet-mention">@UKLabour</span> to nationalise energy system to speed up transition

"British Parliament should determine the level of compensation + it should consider issues such as stranded assets and state subsidies provided since privatisation"

-&gt; this would likely mean a payment for expropriation that is far below “fair market value" <span class="tweet-mention">@DrSimEvans</span> <span class="tweet-mention">@CarbonBrief</span>

# Conclusion

"Governments must remove any obstacles that could prevent or delay the  adoption of emission reduction policies or other mitigation measures."

"carefully  consider  the proposals outlined above and encourage the identification of additional innovative solutions"
