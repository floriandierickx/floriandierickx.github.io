<p class='tweet-para'>GHG review: is documentation there, activity data documented, comparison with international data (are things consistent) ? https://t.co/s10os5v8Zh</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D959ZKBXUAAeaxt.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>GHG Projections are also provided by Parties, and evaluated by other institutes. Data review is not that strong as for GHG review data, because of the inherent uncertainties involved. https://t.co/LQf8xB4kFw</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96HhngWkAEY7uQ.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>In the future the @UNFCCC builds further on an “Enhanced Transparency Framework", based on the existing institutional setup and workflow. https://t.co/ZtRzwzIMca</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96IVJxWwAAZ42g.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>IEA is mandated to collect data for @OECD countries. Data is collected on a voluntary basis of non-member countries, with a strong focus on capacity building. https://t.co/MuBvVUWiqD</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96IWqTWsAEqj3r.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>@IEA data collection for [1] OECD Countries : 5 standardized questionnaires + other data collection streams  and [2] non-OECD : may be in questionnaire format or from other national sources. https://t.co/lXdSXQN2TD</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96IuTCW4AAk8Vv.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>International coordination through “international recommendations for energy statistics” (UN Statistical Commission, 2011) = output from big consultation with different organisations (UNFCCC, IPCC, Eurostat, UNSD). Key = comparability. https://t.co/vlgKAeGYxl</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96JCl3XsAA5Cqi.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Energy data central to GHG inventories : @IEA provides annual comparison data for Annex-I countries = official stage of GHG inventory review. Energy data used for different policy objectives should be comparable and coherent. https://t.co/swCRiMyBNo</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96JMbTWkAEW_c8.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>@IEA compares reported data in CRF Table 1.A(a) [supply-side data] with IEA data. Comparison of time, base year, recent year and trends. Checking of fuels + disaggreagtion of products. https://t.co/RgkwBzRak1</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96Jc9wXUAEg0dZ.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Why is comparability important ? : International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) [https://t.co/amfBIwol72] harmonized classification of national vs. international data, ex: navigation / aviation. Consistency + split between national and international = important. https://t.co/iS8G7TZ3o9</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96KWLwXsAATEYU.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Importance of cooperation at the national level : there should be national arrangements to create and use only one energy data set for different purposes (national reporting, GHG inventories, ..). Also important for non-annex 1 parties where data system is not yet that developed. https://t.co/xKuoTvqFuV</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Situation in Finland : statistical office = responsible for GHG inventories. Reason = capacity in energy statistics in office. https://t.co/4IQ0SefRBm</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96LRv_XsAA5JC5.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Acces to energy data : different registries streamlined. Collaboration happening, but systems not yet fully harmonized (lassifications not the same). Inventories rather strict (no reporting gaps), using complementary sources. Important data = EU ETS dataset. https://t.co/BFNyiV2aaH</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96LYhYXYAAtGQ2.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Confidentiality sometimes prohibits sharing of data. For important sources there are agreements with companies, most sources public. Difficulties : differences in terminology, scope, detail. Harmonisation: same fuel classification in energy statistics and GHG inventory. https://t.co/mV25qPnC5w</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Ministry of environment responsible for data + input from national bureau of statistics. Data originates from NBS (activity + background data). Fugitive emissions: NBS &amp; NEA provide activity data [same dataset]. DFs are from official data + investigations + entreprises. https://t.co/5OWMiSNrWM</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Country specific implementation of  Art. 5 (1) KP [Kyoto Protocol] requirements in Germany: based on agreement of state secretariat of relevant ministries. No official legislation implementing this workflow. GEA in charge of compiling and maintenance of data. [1/3] https://t.co/cGZrRU3IYk</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96OkSTXsAEy8wc.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Core principle of agreement/national system: use previously existing data flows and statistics. Primary data source = official statistics + energy balance. Not included in agreement: access rights to all relevant data for GEA. [2/3]</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>... : this is because of federal structure and federal structure of official statistics —&gt; not always access to background data —&gt; cooperation agreements setup, in particular for confidential data. [3/3]</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Members of WG Group on Energy Balance : ministries + statistical offices + business associations. Arrows = data flows. Eurostat resp. differs from national reporting --&gt; discrepancies. Background data not available, but resolved in enhanced transparency framework. https://t.co/uzSIOXXrUi</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>## Andrew Prag from @IEA on Energy Data for Tracking Progress and Policy Development.

Intro: @IEA is working with @UNFCCC. Also with @OECD climate change expert group (transparency, climate finance, inventories, ...)

Where are we? Where headed? Where to get to? How? https://t.co/ijOJdK8s8G</p>

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96P6TbXsAAT0ij.jpg'/>


<p class='tweet-para'>Where we are : energy-related CO2 emissions record high in 2018. Started in 2017 [tool = GECO https://t.co/ka2OurtOq0]. IEA tries to use the latest data to deliver clear policy messages. Why incease? Growth in energy use, slowdown efficiency increase. https://t.co/49wd7Liq3r</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Where we are headed &amp; where we need to go : global transition indicators. Split between supply and demand + split further down by sectors —&gt; what are technologies involved and how do we see them evolving? (= ‘tracking clean energy progress initiative’) https://t.co/VaswzOW5gh</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Global energy transition indicators, ex: rate of elecricity growth as share of total energy demand, ... Rationale: if to attain SDS scenario, check progress of different indicators. Key reason emission increase = decrased efficiency increase (measured by energy intensity)</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Bridging gap from NPS to SDS scenario requires different actions : renewables increase, efficiency increase, nuclear deployment, CCUs, fuel switching and other meaures. https://t.co/FUE10De4JN</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Conclusions : high-quality statistics are foundation of tracking progress towards climate goals. Combining stats with modelling projections, technology data, and tarnsition indicators : picture of where we need to get to and what to do to get there. IEA data and analysis can help https://t.co/AJOgNDGaLt</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>## Question 1 : What does the SDS scenario contain?
@IEA (Andrew) : It is a well below 2 C scanario, based on IPCC scenarios, for the next 20 years (of course, after 2040 is equally important).</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>## Q2 (Nao Shi from Japanese GHG Inventory : UNFCCC parties submit, then they are reviewed. Transparency, accuracy, completeness is important. Does IEA has a process like this, and what are the characteristics of this process?

@IEA (Matteo) : IEA is reference but is not... [1/2]</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>...the official source. Calculation of emissions comes after. What is really important = underlying data. IEA does carry out data validations, and publishes year-2 or year-1 (supply-side) with basic statistical indicators of quality.  20-25 people are working on data validation.</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>## Q3 : Production of renewable energy does not necessarily lead to consumption of renewable energy [lack of transmission system] How do you take care of this discrepancy?

@IEA (Matteo): Emissions are calculated from the consumption-side. Emissions from power sector... [1/3]</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>...are calculated based on inputs to electricity sector, taking care of transmission losses. There might be differences between consumption and production emissions, but not easy task to calculate.
@GermanEnvAgency : it is indeed not an easy task. [2/3]</p>

<p class='tweet-para'>Ed. note: maybe @BoTranberg @corradio @brunolajoie @ThomasGibon @iain_staffell Gorm Bruun Andresen can help out? ;) https://t.co/RgBkLwLacp [3/3]</p>
