# Donald Cooper - UNFCCC

Donald Cooper from <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span> outlined the importance of data for climate and energy policy, and pointed at the strength of cooperation between the Parties, <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span> and <span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span>

# Barbara Mulik - IEA - Importance of energy data for climate policy

Barbara Mulik from <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span> points at the importance of energy data for climate policy. https://t.co/d8L0yQ6wWg

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D953Pc9XsAUJj4D.jpg'/>

Mulik further points out the importance of arranging a good working collaboration and workflow between Parties and <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span> under the "Enhanced Transparency Framework". Importance of capacity building in this regard. https://t.co/HBBZweLh2t

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D954rLxX4AAiKTP.jpg'/>

GHG review: is documentation there, activity data documented, comparison with international data (are things consistent) ? https://t.co/s10os5v8Zh

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D959ZKBXUAAeaxt.jpg'/>


GHG Projections are also provided by Parties, and evaluated by other institutes. Data review is not that strong as for GHG review data, because of the inherent uncertainties involved. https://t.co/LQf8xB4kFw

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96HhngWkAEY7uQ.jpg'/>


In the future the <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span> builds further on an “Enhanced Transparency Framework", based on the existing institutional setup and workflow. https://t.co/ZtRzwzIMca

# Francesco Mattion - IEA - Data collection procedures

Francesco Mattion from <span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> about IEA's data collection procedures: https://t.co/8XiT8aAe0e

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96IVJxWwAAZ42g.jpg'/>

IEA is mandated to collect data for <span class="tweet-mention">@OECD</span> countries. Data is collected on a voluntary basis of non-member countries, with a strong focus on capacity building. https://t.co/MuBvVUWiqD

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96IWqTWsAEqj3r.jpg'/>


<span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> data collection for [1] OECD Countries : 5 standardized questionnaires + other data collection streams  and [2] non-OECD : may be in questionnaire format or from other national sources. https://t.co/lXdSXQN2TD

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96IuTCW4AAk8Vv.jpg'/>


International coordination through “international recommendations for energy statistics” (UN Statistical Commission, 2011) = output from big consultation with different organisations (UNFCCC, IPCC, Eurostat, UNSD). Key = comparability. https://t.co/vlgKAeGYxl

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96JCl3XsAA5Cqi.jpg'/>


Energy data central to GHG inventories : <span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> provides annual comparison data for Annex-I countries = official stage of GHG inventory review. Energy data used for different policy objectives should be comparable and coherent. https://t.co/swCRiMyBNo

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96JMbTWkAEW_c8.jpg'/>


compares reported data in CRF Table 1.A(a) [supply-side data] with IEA data. Comparison of time, base year, recent year and trends. Checking of fuels + disaggreagtion of products. https://t.co/RgkwBzRak1

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96Jc9wXUAEg0dZ.jpg'/>


Why is comparability important ? : International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) [http://bit.ly/2IKdAoZ](http://bit.ly/2IKdAoZ) harmonized classification of national vs. international data, ex: navigation / aviation. Consistency + split between national and international = important.

<span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> working with <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span> Lead Reviewers on data comparison ("Meeting of GHG Inventory Lead Reviewers") https://t.co/sqWjGSm7Gz

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96KWLwXsAATEYU.jpg'/>


Importance of cooperation at the national level : there should be national arrangements to create and use only one energy data set for different purposes (national reporting, GHG inventories, ..). Also important for non-annex 1 parties where data system is not yet that developed. https://t.co/xKuoTvqFuV

# Country Experiences

## Riita Pipatti - @StatsFinland - GHG Inventory and energy statistics collaboration

Country Experience : Riita Pipatti [http://bit.ly/2IKC29O ] from @StatsFinland on GHG Inventory and energy statistics collaboration - harmonized data for energy and climate policies

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96LJbrWsAEE5si.jpg'/>


Situation in Finland : statistical office = responsible for GHG inventories. Reason = capacity in energy statistics in office. https://t.co/4IQ0SefRBm

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96LRv_XsAA5JC5.jpg'/>


Acces to energy data : different registries streamlined. Collaboration happening, but systems not yet fully harmonized (lassifications not the same). Inventories rather strict (no reporting gaps), using complementary sources. Important data = EU ETS dataset. https://t.co/BFNyiV2aaH

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96LYhYXYAAtGQ2.jpg'/>


Confidentiality sometimes prohibits sharing of data. For important sources there are agreements with companies, most sources public. Difficulties : differences in terminology, scope, detail. Harmonisation: same fuel classification in energy statistics and GHG inventory. https://t.co/mV25qPnC5w

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96LqLIWsAAaEHK.jpg'/>


Mutual benefits of collaboration between energy and GHG inventory teams and institutions : checking and gap filling together, high-level expertise, more in-depth information for policy makers. https://t.co/aIkKAiijPw

## Tian Wang - National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC) China - Energy Data Inventory

Tian Wang from the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC) [http://bit.ly/2IKS0ke](http://bit.ly/2IKS0ke) on Information on China's GHG Inventory related to Energy Data

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96MU9HXoAEAHBi.jpg'/>


Methodologies : energy = biggest source of emissions (80 %) [2012]. Using sector-specific emission factors. Inclusion of Methane and N2O in inventory. More recent inventories should capture more accurate emission factors. https://t.co/DGoZzSIn71

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96NMNsWwAABKmO.jpg'/>


Ministry of environment responsible for data + input from national bureau of statistics. Data originates from NBS (activity + background data). Fugitive emissions: NBS &amp; NEA provide activity data [same dataset]. DFs are from official data + investigations + entreprises. https://t.co/5OWMiSNrWM

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96Nj3TXUAETZG8.jpg'/>


Areas of improvement: energy sector = large. Milestone in 2013: statistical reporting system has been established [first hand data from enterprises, structured by UNFCCC data structure]. Challenges: inconsistency between UNFCCC and national data structure, data dispersed, . [1/2] https://t.co/CiViiSH3bY

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96NoQ_WsAEBPDo.jpg'/>


... some sectors (aviation/maritime) are included ad-hoc. Historical data = expert-based, lack of human resources. QA/QC varies between sectors. + 1996 vs 2006 guidelines transition still happening. [2/2]

## Dirk Gunther - @GermanEnvAgency [Section Emissions Situation] - Germany's institutional arrangements for GHG inventories with respect to energy data

Dirk Gunther [http://bit.ly/2IKO6rv](http://bit.ly/2IKO6rv) from @GermanEnvAgency [Section Emissions Situation] on Germany's institutional arrangements for GHG inventories with respect to energy data

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96OALBXsAI05rr.jpg'/>


Country specific implementation of  Art. 5 (1) KP [Kyoto Protocol] requirements in Germany: based on agreement of state secretariat of relevant ministries. No official legislation implementing this workflow. GEA in charge of compiling and maintenance of data. [1/3] https://t.co/cGZrRU3IYk

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96OkSTXsAEy8wc.jpg'/>


Core principle of agreement/national system: use previously existing data flows and statistics. Primary data source = official statistics + energy balance. Not included in agreement: access rights to all relevant data for GEA. [2/3]

... : this is because of federal structure and federal structure of official statistics —&gt; not always access to background data —&gt; cooperation agreements setup, in particular for confidential data. [3/3]

Members of WG Group on Energy Balance : ministries + statistical offices + business associations. Arrows = data flows. Eurostat resp. differs from national reporting --&gt; discrepancies. Background data not available, but resolved in enhanced transparency framework. https://t.co/uzSIOXXrUi

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96O_SVWsAMmJG8.jpg'/>


Most challenging issue = access to confidential data. The original dataset did not have data ownership included. Currently delay of 1 year in data (before was 3 years). Second most challenging = second-tier data access. https://t.co/PUd7pabRNt

# Andrew Prag - IEA - Energy Data for Tracking Progress and Policy Development

Andrew Prag from <span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> on Energy Data for Tracking Progress and Policy Development.

Intro: <span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> is working with <span class="tweet-mention">@UNFCCC</span>. Also with <span class="tweet-mention">@OECD</span> climate change expert group (transparency, climate finance, inventories, ...)

Where are we? Where headed? Where to get to? How? https://t.co/ijOJdK8s8G

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96P6TbXsAAT0ij.jpg'/>


Where we are : energy-related CO2 emissions record high in 2018. Started in 2017 (tool = GECO [http://bit.ly/2IKjFBP](http://bit.ly/2IKjFBP)). IEA tries to use the latest data to deliver clear policy messages. Why incease? Growth in energy use, slowdown efficiency increase.

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96P7nVXoAADioe.jpg'/>


<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96QhLrXoAAdLfg.jpg'/>


Where we are headed &amp; where we need to go : NPS (New Policies Scenario ['business as usual', ed.] &amp; SDS (Sustainable Development Scenario). SDS includes more than climate goals, also other more ambitious and energy-related elements. https://t.co/pchYj4ozq9

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96Q8Y2XYAALag9.jpg'/>


Where we are headed &amp; where we need to go : global transition indicators. Split between supply and demand + split further down by sectors —&gt; what are technologies involved and how do we see them evolving? (= ‘tracking clean energy progress initiative’) https://t.co/VaswzOW5gh

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96RN1LXYAAxM9p.jpg'/>


Tracking clean energy progress initiative ('traffic light analysis') : 45 different sectors analysed, looking at investment, technology, ... Only 7 good progress. https://t.co/gSUkIY6av8

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96RYMgWkAIYrt2.jpg'/>


Global energy transition indicators, ex: rate of elecricity growth as share of total energy demand, ... Rationale: if to attain SDS scenario, check progress of different indicators. Key reason emission increase = decrased efficiency increase (measured by energy intensity)

Bridging gap from NPS to SDS scenario requires different actions : renewables increase, efficiency increase, nuclear deployment, CCUs, fuel switching and other meaures. https://t.co/FUE10De4JN

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96RrZ7XkAALqLk.jpg'/>


Policy measures to accelerate achievement of NDC —&gt; get analysis down to country-level. Question: what are policy-levers that have most effect in specific countries? Analysis of policies of member states, quick wins. https://t.co/07usqX5Kl7

<img class='twimg' style='max-width: 100%' src='http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D96R7RVWsAEg1BX.jpg'/>


Conclusions : high-quality statistics are foundation of tracking progress towards climate goals. Combining stats with modelling projections, technology data, and tarnsition indicators : picture of where we need to get to and what to do to get there. IEA data and analysis can help https://t.co/AJOgNDGaLt

# Questions

## Q1 : What does the SDS scenario contain?
<span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> (Andrew) : It is a well below 2 C scanario, based on IPCC scenarios, for the next 20 years (of course, after 2040 is equally important).

## Q2 (Nao Shi from Japanese GHG Inventory) : UNFCCC parties submit, then they are reviewed. Transparency, accuracy, completeness is important. Does IEA has a process like this, and what are the characteristics of this process?

<span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> (Matteo) : IEA is reference but is not... [1/2]

...the official source. Calculation of emissions comes after. What is really important = underlying data. IEA does carry out data validations, and publishes year-2 or year-1 (supply-side) with basic statistical indicators of quality.  20-25 people are working on data validation.

## Q3 : Production of renewable energy does not necessarily lead to consumption of renewable energy [lack of transmission system] How do you take care of this discrepancy?

<span class="tweet-mention">@IEA</span> (Matteo): Emissions are calculated from the consumption-side. Emissions from power sector... [1/3]

...are calculated based on inputs to electricity sector, taking care of transmission losses. There might be differences between consumption and production emissions, but not easy task to calculate.
<span class="tweet-mention">@GermanEnvAgency</span> : it is indeed not an easy task. [2/3]

Ed. note: maybe @BoTranberg @corradio @brunolajoie @ThomasGibon @iain_staffell Gorm Bruun Andresen can help out? ;) [https://twitter.com/electricityMap/status/1136531447932772352](https://twitter.com/electricityMap/status/1136531447932772352) … [3/3]
