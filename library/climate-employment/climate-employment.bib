  abstract = {Energy sustainable strategies in Europe advocate increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E) in response to the need of reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. RES-E production is considered to have a prominent role in the crusade against climate change and in Europe's energy security. Renewable energy technology (RET) deployment is also sought for promoting a large number of jobs. Nevertheless, the exact number of jobs created is presented with large discrepancies across recent studies. The use of different methodologies but also the consideration of different assumptions even when the same methodology is applied has implications on the variability of employment estimates. This paper is aimed at providing a clearer understanding of what are the implications of government support for RES-E on jobs, and to see if current claims over employment benefits are too optimistic or even pessimistic in light of these findings. Taking Portugal as a case study, this paper conveys an assessment of the impact of renewable energy targets for electricity generation on employment for the years 2008\textendash{}2020. The analysis is conducted by means of the Input-Output (IO) approach (quantity and price models) and considering the different life cycle stages of RES-E and conventional electricity (CE) power plants. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Electricity generation from renewable sources has been touted as a win-win solution for the advancement towards both environmental sustainability and decent work for all. This paper analyses the employment effects of electricity generation by different sources on a worldwide scale as observed since the year 2000. It finds that the additional generation from renewable, non-hydro, energy sources has been related to higher job creation in the electricity sector when compared to other energy sources, notably fossil fuel-based technologies. As predicted, renewables also help reduce GHG emissions. Estimating the economy-wide effects through employment multipliers provide more evidence that developing renewable energy has positive environmental and employment impact throughout the entire economy.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement lays out the objective of keeping global warming below 2 \textdegree{}C. The goal can be achieved by increasing both the share of renewables in the energy mix and energy efficiency. Such action entails a transformation of the energy sector, which, given its linkages with the rest of the economy, will have a knock-on effect on other sectors. Using scenarios based on a multiregional input\textendash{}output database, this article explores the economy-wide and worldwide employment impact of such a transition. Findings suggest that by 2030 most economies will experience net job creation and reallocation across industries. Job creation is driven by the construction, manufacturing and renewables sectors.},

  abstract = {The transition towards decarbonized and efficient energy systems has broad socio-economic implications. We estimate the potential impacts on employment from efforts in energy efficiency in industry, transport and buildings as well as substituting local renewable energy sources for fossil fuels. Both energy supply and demand are accounted for. We use a hybrid approach that combines national energy transition scenarios with input\textendash{}output tables, adjusted for new energy and non-energy activities. We conclude that the transition has a net positive impact on employment as illustrated by the case of Switzerland. The local and decentralized nature of energy efficiency and renewables retains a greater share of value-added domestically than does a supply chain of fossil fuels. Moreover, we find that more jobs are created in demand-side activities, such as building renovation, than in renewable energy generation. Positive impacts on jobs from spillover effects in all non-energy activities are also found.},
