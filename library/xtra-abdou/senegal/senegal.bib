  abstract = {Meeting Sub-Saharan African (SSA) human development goals will require economic development to be the priority over the coming decades, but economic development `at all cost' may not be acceptable across these goals. This paper aims to explore five development scenarios for the five largest economies in SSA to understand the implications to CO2-equivalent emissions (CO2-e) and off-grid energy modernisation in 2030. Within this scope GDP growth; economic structure; availability of energy resources; international trade; and, the development of distributed generation for remote locations are considered. Regional CO2 emissions were studied using a Multi-Regional Input-Output Model for Africa. Under the scenarios analysed all five nations will be unable to reduce 2030 CO2-e emissions below 2012 levels, whilst simultaneously achieving forecast GDP growth and universal access to modernised energy services. 100\% off-grid modernisation is estimated to require a three-fold increase in Primary Energy Supply and a 26\% (1317Mt) increase in 2030 CO2-e emissions. Total regional CO2-e emissions could be reduced from 45\% to 35\% by meeting a 50\% renewable energy supply target by 2030. Climate Change policy would need to focus on multi-sector reform to reduce regional emissions as the agricultural sector is the largest emitter in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya.},

  abstract = {Ecological Tax Reform (ETR) is featuring high on the policy agenda. The key idea is to shift the tax burden from 'goods', such as productive labour, to 'bads' such as energy use and environmental pollution. Since the 1980s, most OECD countries have installed several environmental taxes and several reports provide an assessment of these instruments. Attention for ETR in developing countries is of a more recent nature and very little information on their ETRs is available. This review paper contributes to the effort by screening nine African countries: Algeria, Benin, Mali, Mozambique, Tanzania, Niger, Senegal, Uganda and South Africa. Data on environmental taxes was collected through various sources. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of the art with regards to environmental taxation in these selected countries. We show that there are currently several interesting initiatives in several countries.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement of COP21 set a goal of holding global average temperature increases to below 2\textdegree{}C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\textdegree{}C. This is particularly relevant for the African context where temperatures are likely to warm faster than the global average, the magnitude of change regionally heterogeneous and many biogeophysical and socioeconomic systems particularly vulnerable to change. In this paper we conduct a short review of the literature to contextualise the lack of regional climate information under global warming levels of 1,5 and 2\textdegree{}C above pre-industrial levels. Most studies that provide information over Africa under specific GWLs have used data from global models, however global models cannot resolve local scale forcing (e.g. topography) nor the internal climate variability of a region. Although downscaling using regional climate models can address this, we find only one paper that has used downscaled data in GWL studies over Africa. Articles in this focus collection use data from CORDEX and GCMs to elucidate the regional and local scale climate responses to various warming levels. This may provide information that contributes meaningfully to the UNFCCC negotiation process and also for the development of adaptation and mitigation policies.},

  abstract = {There is a general lack of information about the potential effects of 1.5, 2 or more degrees of global warming on the regional climates within Africa, and most studies that address this use data from coarse resolution global models. Using a large ensemble of CORDEX Africa simulations, we present a pan-African overview of the effects of 1.5 and 2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C global warming levels (GWLs) on the African climate. The CORDEX simulations, consistent with their driving global models, show a robust regional warming exceeding the mean global one over most of Africa. The highest increase in annual mean temperature is found over the subtropics and the smallest one over many coastal regions.
Projected changes in annual mean precipitation have a tendency to wetter conditions in some parts of Africa (e.g. central/eastern Sahel and eastern Africa) at both GWLs, but models' agreement on the sign of change is low. In contrast to mean precipitation, there is a consistent increase in daily precipitation intensity of wet days over a large fraction of tropical Africa emerging already at 1.5 {$\smwhtcircle$}C
GWL and strengthening at 2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. A consistent difference between 2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C and 1.5{$\smwhtcircle$}Cwarmings is also found for projected changes in annual mean temperature and daily precipitation intensity. Our study indicates that a 0.5 {$\smwhtcircle$}C furtherwarming (from1.5{$\smwhtcircle$}C\textendash{}2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C) can indeed produce a robust change in some aspects of the African climate and its extremes.},

Global climate model simulations from the Coupled Model intercomparison project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to drive the RCMs and determine timing of the targeted global warming levels. The regional warming differ considerably over Central
Africa for 1.5\textdegree{}C and 2\textdegree{}C warming levels. Compared to changes in temperature, changes in precipitation are more heterogeneous and climate model simulations indicate of lack consensus across the region, though there is tendency towards decrease of seasonal
precipitation and reduction of consecutive wet days. As a drought indicator, significant increase of consecutive dry days was found. Consistent changes of maximum 5-day rainfall are detected between 1.5\textdegree{}C vs. 2\textdegree{}C global warming levels.},

We here explore the spread of climate change impact projections and develop a composite impact measure to identify hotspots of climate change impacts, addressing likelihood and strength of impacts. Overlapping impacts in different biosphere properties (e.g. flooding, yields) will not only claim additional capacity to respond, but will also narrow the options to respond and develop. Regions with severest projected climate change impacts often coincide with regions of high population density and poverty rates.

  volume = {106},
  issn = {0921-8181},
  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L) is one of the most important food crops and very common in all parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010 53 million tons of maize were produced in sub-Saharan Africa on about one third of the total harvested cropland area (similar to 33 million ha). Our aim is to identify the limiting agroclimatic variable for maize growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa by analyzing the separated and combined effects of temperature and precipitation. Under changing climate, both climate variables are projected to change severely, and their impacts on crop yields are frequently assessed using process-based crop models. However it is often unclear which agroclimatic variable will have the strongest influence on crop growth and development under climate change and previous studies disagree over this question. We create synthetic climate data in order to study the effect of large changes in the length of the wet season and the amount of precipitation during the wet season both separately and in combination with changes in temperature. The dynamic global vegetation model for managed land LPJmL is used to simulate maize yields under current and future climatic conditions for the two 10-year periods 2056-2065 and 2081-2090 for three climate scenarios for the A1b emission scenario but without considering the beneficial CO2 fertilization effect. The importance of temperature and precipitation effects on maize yields varies spatially and we identify four groups of crop yield changes: regions with strong negative effects resulting from climate change ({$<$}-33\% yield change), regions with moderate (-33\% to -10\% yield change) or slight negative effects (-10\% to +6\% yield change), and regions with positive effects arising from climate change mainly in currently temperature-limited high altitudes ({$>$}+6\% yield change). In the first three groups temperature increases lead to maize yield reductions of 3 to 20\%, with the exception of mountainous and thus cooler regions in South and East Africa. A reduction of the wet season precipitation causes decreases in maize yield of at least 30\% and prevails over the effect of increased temperatures in southern parts of Mozambique and Zambia, the Sahel and parts of eastern Africa in the two projection periods. This knowledge about the limiting abiotic stress factor in each region will help to prioritize future research needs in modeling of agricultural systems as well as in drought and heat stress breeding programs and to identify adaption options in agricultural development projects. On the other hand the study enhances the understanding of temperature and water stress effects on crop yields in a global vegetation model in order to identify future research and model development needs.

  abstract = {In January 2001, the OECD held an expert seminar as part of a pilot project to investigate interactions between the long term agenda for climate change and sustainable development strategies. Experts from both OECD and developing countries attended. Participants identified issues and approaches, based on their regional perspectives, relevant to an evolving, equitable regime for addressing climate change, given various national circumstances, political interests, institutions and capacities to achieve sustainable development objectives. They stressed the importance of both climate mitigation and adaptation policy within a sustainable development framework. Discussions and presentations centred around two broad themes: Synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development objectives and long-term strategies to limit climate change; and How to build analytical and implementation capacity in developing countries to maximise synergies at local, regional and global levels of decision-making. To support seminar discussions, the OECD commissioned several papers (including this one) from non- OECD country experts; authors were asked to comment on key interactions between climate change and sustainable development from their own regional or national perspectives. This paper is being released as an informal working paper in the hope that it will continue to stimulate interest and discussions on these topics in other fora. The paper argues that for West African countries in general the biggest preoccupation in the climate change context is building resilience, reducing vulnerability of poorer and marginalized communities and adapting to the negative impacts of environmental degradation rather than climate mitigation per se. One key step in that direction would be to ensure better governance frameworks.},

The government and many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have tried to comprehend and have strived to address the problem of energy. This paper presents a review of activities in the field of renewable energy applications in Senegal, which goes back to the mid 1970s and will discuss the socio-economic benefits that the country has derived from these environmentally sound and appropriate sources of energy. The development and trial of systems were mostly funded so far by donor agencies in collaboration with government and NGOs. Among the applications being supported are solar lighting, water pumping and small power plants. Recent efforts have been aimed at restructuring the programmes and giving them a market orientation. Future trends, some suggestions and recommendations for successful dissemination of renewable energy sources are also drawn. The present situation is seen to be much more promising and favourable for renewable energy.},

  abstract = {Background: Climate and environment vary across many spatio-temporal scales, including the concept of climate change, which impact on ecosystems, vector-borne diseases and public health worldwide.Objectives: To develop a conceptual approach by mapping climatic and environmental conditions from space and studying their linkages with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemics in Senegal.Design: Ponds in which mosquitoes could thrive were identified from remote sensing using high-resolution SPOT-5 satellite images. Additional data on pond dynamics and rainfall events (obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) were combined with hydrological in-situ data. Localisation of vulnerable hosts such as penned cattle (from QuickBird satellite) were also used.Results: Dynamic spatio-temporal distribution of Aedes vexans density (one of the main RVF vectors) is based on the total rainfall amount and ponds' dynamics. While Zones Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes are mapped, detailed risk areas, i.e. zones where hazards and vulnerability occur, are expressed in percentages of areas where cattle are potentially exposed to mosquitoes' bites.Conclusions: This new conceptual approach, using precise remote-sensing techniques, simply relies upon rainfall distribution also evaluated from space. It is meant to contribute to the implementation of operational early warning systems for RVF based on both natural and anthropogenic climatic and environmental changes. In a climate change context, this approach could also be applied to other vector-borne diseases and places worldwide.},

  abstract = {International development policy makers are recognizing climate change and desertification as fundamental obstacles to the social and economic development of the Third World. Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the Sahel region, has been severely impacted by the compounding effects of drought, deforestation and desertification. The Senegal River Basin in the West Africa is a prime example of a region where development objectives are seriously undermined by the drought-induced desertification process. The basic hydrologic constraint on development is revealed in a time series decompositionof Senegal River annual flow volumes, which strongly suggests that water resources availability has been substantially curtailed since 1960. Two alternative time series mechanisms are hypothesized to account for the decreased flow volumes in recent decades. The first time series model suggests the presence of a long-term periodicity, while the second model hypothesizes an ARMA(1,1,) process. The second hypothesis provides a superior model fit. The stationary ARMA(1,1) model can be fitted successfully, however, only after explicitly removing a non-stationary component by linearly detrending after 1960. The implication of non-stationarity in Senegal River hydrology provides additional analytic evidence that the landscape degradation and desertification processes observed in Sahelian Africa can be in part attributed to climate change effects. Efforts to redress desertification should be at once conscious of complex socioeconomic forces exacerbating the desertification process and fundamental hydrologic constraints to river basin development.},

  abstract = {\textendash{} The purpose of this publication is to present a didactic concept with the targeted impact of a positive future vision. This paper reflects the effect of local educational action on the development of regionally optimised visions in rural regions of a European industrial state, compared with a rural region in the developing country of Senegal., \textendash{} An assessment and analysis of two conceptual approaches to education and technology is conducted with a view to participating in a future multicultural participatory design process, and identifying the chances that communities have to build future-oriented structures that support local roots and development., \textendash{} In the short-term, the technological and material results are the targeted localisation of a windmill in the (physical and cultural) countryside. In the long-term, educative and social results are expected to strengthen local civil society, which is initiated by empowering students through their self-responsibility in the Alpine region of Greifenburg, Austria. The ``windmill'' in the region is a publicly visible sign and a technology-based icon in the landscape, based on local consensus on several levels and inspiring further regional consensus on energy, climate protection and its active creation through entrepreneurship in civil society., \textendash{} Technology serves as a catalyst to trigger social cohesion among multiple cultures in a region and to enhance conviviality.},

An analytical framework to compare the energy and measurable environmental impacts of a set of scenarios is developed, and the limitations of the quantitative approach are discussed. It is found that policies to promote substitution of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) for charcoal use in households may actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while also improving more important near-term environmental problems. Substitution of LPG for charcoal would not necessarily lead to a significant increase in Senegal's oil import bill, since other petroleum product usage will continue to dominate. Despite past industrial sector initiatives, considerable potential for energy efficiency investment remains, and presents additional opportunities for minimizing environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {We assess the impact of a statistical bias correction method based on histogram equalization functions on the projected climate change signals of regional climate model (RCM) simulations over the Senegal River Basin in West Africa. Focus is given to projected changes in precipitation, temperature, and potential water balance (P - PET) following the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenario pathways by the end of the 21st century (2071\textendash{}2100) compared to the 1971\textendash{}2000 reference period. We found that applying the bias correction substantially improved the simulations of present day climate for both temporal and spatial variations of the analysed climate parameters when compared to gridded observations data sets and station data. For the future, the non-corrected RCM projections show a general decrease of precipitation by the end of 21st century for both scenarios over the majority of the basin, except the Guinean highlands where a slight increase is found. The reduction in mean precipitation is accompanied by a projected increase in the annual number of dry days, most pronounced in the northern basin. Furthermore, a general temperature increase is projected over the entire basin for both scenarios, but more pronounced under the RCP8.5 scenario. In addition, the deficit in the water balance (P - PET) above 12\textdegree{}N is projected to increase in the future. Applying the bias correction to the RCM projections leads to a general dampening of the projected change signals, strongest in the case of heavy precipitation events. However, for all analysed parameters the general directions of change as well as the predominant large-scale change patterns are conserved after applying the bias correction.},

The paper points out that long term development strategies and large programmes with significant financial resources are essential to achieving substantial results in terms of energy access. The paper argues that building up the energy infrastructure (power plants, grid interconnections and small-scale decentralized energy options in rural areas.) is a pre-condition for economic growth and ultimately for energy access. It underlines that historically there is a trend towards more efficient, convenient and cost effective forms of energy. Low carbon path and above all renewable will therefore play an increasing role in the energy mix in the next couple of decades. Manufacturing of capital goods for the renewable energy industry in Africa will be a key challenge to achieving energy security economic growth and energy access.},

  title = {Monitoring and {{Tracking Long}}-{{Term Finance}} to {{Support Climate Action}}},
  abstract = {The Canc{\'u}n Agreements formalise a collective commitment by developed countries to provide new and additional funding for action on climate change in developing countries both in the short- and longer-term. This collective financial commitment requires a system to measure, report and verify (MRV) the relevant financial flows across a variety of sources. However, the existing effort to track climate finance lacks transparency, comparability and comprehensiveness. The paper highlights the relevant information that needs to be tracked in order to build a comprehensive MRV system for climate finance, proposing both improvements to current reporting and tracking systems as well as new reporting approaches for a more robust and inclusive MRV system. The paper suggests tracking information along a multi-dimensional structure. This structure is aspirational, to be achieved and added to over time. Certain elements of it might not be feasible in the near term but could be developed with a targeted effort. For example, while not a priority in the near-term it is important to recognise the growing importance of South-South financial flows to support climate action and to anticipate adding reporting on this in future. Of course such a system must also be built up slowly, allowing reporting countries to build capacity to provide higher quality and more complete information over time. In particular, the paper outlines two strawman proposals for reporting on climate finance that integrate existing and new UNFCCC vehicles for reporting or recording information, (i.e. national communications and biennial reports, the registry) as well as drawing on other reporting systems. These are: (i) reporting through limited sources; or (ii) reporting through expanded sources, building on broader institutional collaboration and non-party reporting. Both `strawman' proposals foresee an important oversight role from the UNFCCC to serve as recipient of all data, and to co-ordinate the verification and review and/or international consultation and analysis process. Both options advance a more comprehensive system for storing and accessing data on international climate finance and will facilitate comparison and integration of data across sources.},

The result from the Toda and Yomamoto granger causality test showed a mix of bidirectional, unidirectional, and neutral relationships for all countries. Whilst in Senegal carbon dioxide emission was not found to be a limiting factor to economic growth; it was found to act as a limiting factor to economic growth in Morocco and Ghana. Lastly, the result from the variance decomposition analysis revealed that economic growth contributes largely to changes in future carbon dioxide emissions in Senegal and Morocco whilst in Ghana technical efficiency contributes largely to changes in future variations in carbon dioxide emissions.

  abstract = {Climate variability and change affect most socioeconomic sectors in West Africa. It is now admitted that the variability of climate has increased since the 1950s mainly because of the increased concentration of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this study, we analyze the evolution of some extreme temperature and precipitation indices over a large area of West Africa spanning from latitudes 10\textendash{}25\textdegree{}N and longitudes 17\textdegree{}W\textendash{}15\textdegree{}E. The results show a general warming trend throughout the region during the period from 1960 to 2010, namely through a negative trend in the number of cool nights, and more frequent warm days and warm spells. This was the case not only for locations inside the continent, but also for those in coastal areas. Trends in rainfall related indices are not as uniform as the ones in temperatures. Nevertheless, a general tendency of decreased annual total rainfall and maximum number of consecutive wet days characterizes the study period. The cumulated rainfall of extremely wet days shows a positive trend in most locations. As for the maximum number of consecutive wet days, it shows an overall decreasing trend from 1960 to the mid 1980s, but starting from the late 1980s, an increasing trend is observed in several locations, indicating that extreme rainfall events have become more frequent in the West African Sahel during the last decade, compared to the 1961\textendash{}1990 period. Policy implications of these observed trends may include investment and promotion of low cost and environmentally friendly energy production systems, the redesign of infrastructure and production systems to account for higher risks of losses due to floods and/or droughts, and the promotion of research for more heat tolerant crop/animal species and cultivars/breeds.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the role of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) projects play as a simultaneously mitigative and adaptive response to climate change. We develop a general conceptual framework that illustrates how introducing modern energy services through decentralized renewable energy can stabilize the ecological and social determinants of climate change vulnerability, while performing a critical climate change mitigation function. This framework is developed through a high-level overview of the key implications of rural energy deprivation: deforestation and ecosystem degradation (with significant greenhouse gas emissions implications), chronic rural poverty, and high vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change. We then explore global sustainable development pathways and the integral role that decentralized renewable energy can play in stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. We then describe how mitigation and adaptation synergies provide avenues for integrating sustainable development with climate policy, contextualized with respect to key relationships between the Millennium Development Goals and access to energy. We then turn to the related issue of poverty and climate change in the context of how climate stresses exacerbate poverty by impairing the ecosystem services upon which the poor rely heavily. The conceptual framework concludes with a full description of the role DREs play in rural agroecosystems, particularly how DREs can enhance the flow of regulatory and provisioning ecosystem services, and expand livelihood opportunities\textemdash{}all of which builds adaptive capacity for climate change. The paper concludes with some comments and recommendations for enhancing the constructive role for DRE in overcoming the perceived divide between climate change mitigation and adaptation policy.},

The practice of widening modern energy services access to the poor in Africa is complex, and exacerbated by the dual nature of the energy system across Sub-Saharan Africa where traditional and modern energy systems and practices co-exist. This presents major challenges for policy makers who have to contend with a fragmented energy system, which requires the mobilisation of an array of actors at cross-sectoral levels in order to develop effective institutions and implement innovative policy frameworks. This paper further argues that, the `energy access' discussion needs to take place in the context of energy transitions, giving due consideration to the productive sector as an important vehicle for change. As the link between energy and development is context specific, each African country needs to chart its own energy transition pathway into the future, and there are ample lessons that they can draw from previous energy transitions.},

  abstract = {Sound climate risk management requires access to the best available decision-relevant climate information and the ability to use such information effectively. The availability and access of such information and the ability to use it is challenging, particularly throughout rural Africa. A gap analysis published by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) and the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) in 2005 explored these challenges in detail and identified four key gaps: (i) gaps in integration of climate into policy; (ii) gaps in integration of climate into practice at scale; (iii) gaps in climate services; and (iv) gaps in climate data. Though this document was published nearly nine years ago, the gaps it highlighted are still relevant today. In the last decade, IRI has been making efforts to address these critical issues in a systematic way through projects and partnerships in Africa. This paper describes IRI's efforts in Ethiopia, a country particularly prone to climate related risks. Here we outline a creative solution to bridge the gaps in the availability, access and use of national climate information through the Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) initiative. We then discuss how policy and practice has changed as a result of IRI engagement in the development of climate services in the water, public health and agricultural sectors. The work in Ethiopia is indicative of the efforts IRI is implementing in other countries in Africa and in other parts of the world.},

The article documents REEEP's 5 years of experience in energy efficiency and renewable energy programme delivery, as well as market development in developing countries; it describes the delivery mechanisms, process, and governance before proceeding to analyse the REEEP portfolio. The article then assesses REEEP's experience in delivering a capacity building initiative, identifying lessons in the areas of programme management, carbon finance, financing, business models, energy in buildings, rural energy, energy regulation, and energy policy. The article demonstrates that REEEP programmes offer a number of lessons for policy makers and managers involved in climate change and development issues in developing countries. It also shows that REEEP is positioned to scale-up its activities and respond to requests that are currently constrained by limited resources. The article concludes by recommending the scaling up of REEEP's operations.},

  abstract = {In Senegal, the drought of 1970 that affected sub-Saharan Africa was the turning point at which environmental changes were identified as a direct consequence of climate change. Remarkable changes occurred regarding rainfall variability, loss of biodiversity, drought and an increase in aridity. The degradation and modification of access to natural resources, consequences of ecological and politic issues, represent serious socio-environmental challenges considering that 70 \% of the population relies directly on natural resources for survival.In the rural communities of the Sahelo-Sudanian area of Bakel, a majority of the 200,000 citizens depends on animal husbandry and farming activities. Affected by climate change, these rural communities are now facing a lack of water resources in addition to environmental degradation, strongly impacted by unmanaged transhumance, deforestation and bushfire. However, Bakel communities adapt to climate change and try to be resilient in the face of environmental risk and disaster, using local knowledge to mitigate vulnerability and insecurity.Specifically, adaptation strategies put in place range from agricultural and livelihood diversification, innovation to land restoration. These practices are sustained by a local non-governmental organization (NGO) working in local development through strengthening capacities and transferring knowledge.Concepts of vulnerability, governance, local development, adaptation, strengthening capacities and resilience are applied to the socio-environmental context of the Bakel district.},

  abstract = {Electrification is increasingly proposed as a solution to the problem of Africa's development. International organizations hope to light `a dark continent', converting solar panels and global investment into jobs and thereby aiding Africa's emergence into the global economy. Such straightforward expectations, however, are at odds with longstanding research in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and on-the-ground realities. This article examines the proposed energy transition in Senegal, drawing on over eight months of ethnographic observation at three sites: an energy conference in Dakar; the National Ecovillage Agency (ANEV), a body implementing the national energy project; and an energy development NGO designing alternative solutions for Africa's poor. Using the STS concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, this article highlights two visions of the transition: an internationalist discourse in which technologies like solar panels, supported by foreign aid, are expected to transform society; and a locally embedded approach in which social conditions determine desirable futures, assisted by technology. The former is shown to create dependence on the universalist imaginaries of the industrial world, while the latter is reduced to a scramble for development projects and funding. Africa's emergence, I argue, requires greater attentiveness to social and political institution building than to kW-hours and foreign dollars.},

  abstract = {Ground temperature and albedo values were studied in a semiarid, sub-Saharan region of Africa, Senegal, for various days in the period of September 1981 to October 1982. The albedo and ground temperature were found to be positively correlated; i.e., regions of high albedo were regions of high ground temperature, and regions of low albedo were regions of low ground temperature. Highest values of ground temperature and albedo were found in a region characterized by sparse vegetation and in the dry season. Lowest values of ground temperature and albedo were found in regions characterized by dense vegetation and in the wet season. These results suggest that regions of high albedo in the sub-Saharan region of west Africa are regions of high ground temperature. Mechanisms for increasing the ground temperature under high albedo conditions are discussed. The increased ground temperature will increase the long wave radiation emitted to the atmosphere and the sensible heat flux at the surface. Therefore, there can be a net heat gain in the local atmosphere which will result in a general rising motion. These results are in contrast to those proposed by Charney (1975), who suggested that an increased albedo in semidesert regions will cause a net radiation loss, contributing to net cooling, sinking, and drying of the air aloft.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {0973-0826},
  abstract = {While much of the industrialised world is embracing biomass energy as a pillar of low-carbon growth, a review of national energy policies in sub-Saharan Africa reveals that biomass is widely viewed as a retrogressive source of energy that degrades the environment and engenders poverty. Initiatives to formulate alternative energy policies based on recognition, formalisation and modernisation of the sector are not appreciated by decision-makers in government, whose vision of economic growth and poverty reduction is usually based on fossil fuels and electricity. The authors argue that as long as the significant contribution and future potential of biomass energy to generate employment, support urban\textendash{}rural revenue flow, strengthen domestic energy security and drive green economic development remain unrecognised, African governments will continue to endorse `anything-but-biomass' policies. In this context, the development of new sector strategies that give biomass a higher profile faces a significant political challenge and may ultimately prove futile. To bring about change it is argued that first, a new image of biomass energy must be articulated, which offers a compelling and achievable vision of modernisation in production, processing, distribution and consumption. This requires an integrated set of measures to communicate the message of change, promote enabling framework conditions, expand sustainable biomass supplies, strengthen regional economies and value-addition, and capitalise on recent technological advancement. Second, valorisation of forest resources is essential to stimulate sustainable production, conversion and consumption, and can be achieved through interventions in governance, taxation, regulation and technology. Third, the modernisation process should capitalise on momentous technological advances in stoves, kilns, processing systems and means of salvaging waste energy for productive use. Fourth, replication and scale-up of the modernisation movement can be leveraged using new and innovative funding sources.},

According to the results of our optimal energy option's analysis, at project scale, compared with a diesel-only energy option, photovoltaic (PV)\textendash{}diesel (PVDB), wind\textendash{}diesel (WDB) and PV\textemdash{}wind\textendash{}diesel (PVWDB) hybrids are very cost-effective energy options. Moreover, energy options with high levels of renewable energy, including 100\% renewables, have the lowest net present cost and they are already cost effective without CDM. On the other hand, while the removal of about 87\% carbon dioxide emissions could be achieved at negative cost, initial investment could increase by a factor of 40, which is one of the primary barriers hindering wider renewable energy applications in developing countries, among others. Thus, in order to increase developing countries' participation in the carbon market, CDM policy should shift from a purely market-oriented approach to investigating how to facilitate renewable energy projects through barrier removal. Thus, we recommend that further research should focus on how to efficiently remove renewable energy implementation barriers as a means to improve developing countries' participation in meaningful emission reduction while at the same time meeting the needs of sustainable economic development.},

  abstract = {The Senegal River Basin (SRB) is a shared watershed in West Africa which includes regions (the upper basin, valley, and delta), characterized by distinct environmental conditions. An important feature of the Senegal River flow volume historically was its inter-annual irregularity, which caused a major water resource constrain. This situation has been accentuated during the long-term drought (1969\textendash{}1984) in the Sahel zone which highlights the vulnerability of food-producing systems to climate change and variability. SRB is undergoing fundamental environmental, hydrologic, and socioeconomic transitions and represents a good illustration of sensitivity to climatic variations and opportunities for adaptation. This paper aims to study water resources systems under stress from climate variability and change in the Senegal River Basin. The results show (1) through the compilation of available data, information and knowledge (sedimentological, climatical, geological, environmental, archeological, etc.), the chronological consequences of climate change during the past millennium in West Africa, and also (2) an analysis of the recent impacts and vulnerability to climate change in the SRB and finally (3) the adaptation strategies in the SRB in order to identify and resolve problems associated with this water scarcity and to address the potential for guaranteed agricultural production in this narrow geographic area.},

  abstract = {Le S{\'e}n{\'e}gal est un pays en d{\'e}veloppement qui n'a pas de ressources naturelles importantes et qui est situ{\'e} dans la zone sah{\'e}lienne du continent africain. C'est donc un pays qui n'est pas, pour ainsi dire, g{\^a}t{\'e} par la nature. Malgr{\'e} cet {\'e}tat de fait, ce pays a su construire et consolider, depuis son accession {\`a} l'ind{\'e}pendance en 1960, une nation, ainsi qu'un {\'e}tat de droit stable et d{\'e}mocratique. Il n'a pas abrit{\'e} de guerre civile ou de conflit politique violent et a r{\'e}sist{\'e} {\`a} toutes les s{\'e}cheresses dans la r{\'e}gion, {\'e}vitant ainsi toute catastrophe humanitaire.
Sur le plan {\'e}conomique, il a {\'e}galement su s'adapter aux crises majeures de la seconde moiti{\'e} du XXe si{\`e}cle, mais aussi aux dures p{\'e}riodes d'ajustement structurel impos{\'e}es par le FMI qui ont dur{\'e} une vingtaine d'ann{\'e}es, ainsi qu'{\`a} la d{\'e}valuation du franc CFA, dont la valeur a {\'e}t{\'e} divis{\'e}e par deux en 1994. 

Depuis 2014, la croissance moyenne du PIB a {\'e}t{\'e} sup{\'e}rieure {\`a} 6,5\% par an avec une perspective stable jusqu'en 2022 selon le FMI. Cependant, sa consommation d'{\'e}nergie n'{\'e}tait que de 0,27 Tep, dont 230 kWh d'{\'e}lectricit{\'e} , et a g{\'e}n{\'e}r{\'e} 0,54 tC02/hab en 2016 . Ces chiffres sont {\'e}videmment faibles, symptomatiques d'une {\'e}conomie qui ne consomme pas beaucoup d'{\'e}nergie et caract{\'e}ristiques d'un pays en d{\'e}veloppement. N{\'e}anmoins, la consommation d'{\'e}nergie du S{\'e}n{\'e}gal a connu une croissance rapide de + 3,6\%/an en moyenne depuis 2000 , en raison des effets combin{\'e}s des croissances {\'e}conomique et d{\'e}mographique. Dans le m{\^e}me temps, le S{\'e}n{\'e}gal ambitionne de passer d'un taux d'{\'e}lectrification national de 60\% en 2017 {\`a} l'acc{\`e}s universel {\`a} l'{\'e}lectricit{\'e} en 2030, tout en menant une politique {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique {\`a} faibles {\'e}missions.

D'embl{\'e}e, il semble {\'e}vident que l'atteinte de tels objectifs, avec les contraintes qui lui sont propres, ne pourra se faire sans une politique d'efficacit{\'e} {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique ad{\'e}quate et performante. L'objectif de cette {\'e}tude est, par cons{\'e}quent, d'analyser la pertinence de la politique d'efficacit{\'e} {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique actuelle du S{\'e}n{\'e}gal, compte-tenu de ses ambitions {\'e}conomiques et des principaux enjeux du pays tels que l'ind{\'e}pendance {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique et la s{\'e}curit{\'e} d'approvisionnement face {\`a} la demande croissante, l'acc{\`e}s universel {\`a} une {\'e}lectricit{\'e} abordable et le changement climatique.},

La recherche prend appui sur un cadre th{\'e}orique construit {\`a} partir de la th{\'e}orie de la gouvernance des communs {\`a} laquelle nous avons combin{\'e} les approches de la psychosociologie des repr{\'e}sentations sociales, de la socio-anthropologie du d{\'e}veloppement et de la sociologie de la transaction sociale. Notre zone d'{\'e}tude est constitu{\'e}e par le delta du Saloum qui est form{\'e} par un entrelacs d'{\^i}les riches en biodiversit{\'e} mais vuln{\'e}rables au changement climatique. En outre, les dynamiques sociales t{\'e}moignent de l'entrain dans la production du quotidien par les femmes, les jeunes et les projets de d{\'e}veloppement. {\`A} partir d'une posture {\'e}pist{\'e}mologique bas{\'e}e sur le \guillemotleft{} paradigme \guillemotright{} de la pens{\'e}e complexe et la perspective d'une \guillemotleft{} connaissance subjectale \guillemotright, la m{\'e}thode de recherche est essentiellement qualitative avec une d{\'e}marche ethnographique. {\`A} partir de l'{\'e}tude de cas, l'utilisation d'une batterie d'outils (revue documentaire, observation, entretiens individuels et de groupe) a d{\'e}bouch{\'e} sur une diversit{\'e} de mat{\'e}riaux discursifs et factuels. L'analyse des donn{\'e}es de terrain a {\'e}t{\'e} men{\'e}e par rapport aux dimensions suivantes : les dispositifs organisationnels, les rapports d'action et d'interaction dans l'action collective, l'intentionnalit{\'e} et l'incertitude des pratiques sociales, l'historicit{\'e}, l'espace et la prospective. Nos r{\'e}sultats de recherche laissent voir que, nonobstant un contexte de changement climatique contraignant et l'existence de repr{\'e}sentations sociales diff{\'e}rentielles dues {\`a} la pr{\'e}sence d'une multiplicit{\'e} d'acteurs au sein de l'espace du delta du Saloum, la gestion des communs (p{\^e}cheries et foresterie) est r{\'e}ussie {\`a} travers les organisations communautaires et les structures m{\^e}l{\'e}es de comp{\'e}tences d'acteurs sociaux, {\'e}tatiques et non-gouvernementaux au moyen de transactions sociales pour la conservation des ressources naturelles par un \guillemotleft{} ordre n{\'e}goci{\'e} \guillemotright{} de durabilit{\'e} d'une part, et d'autre part, les usages des b{\'e}n{\'e}fices collectifs issus de leur exploitation pour r{\'e}aliser des projets communautaires. En effet, l'action collective des diff{\'e}rents acteurs sociaux et institutionnels qui a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}sign{\'e}e \guillemotleft{} connexit{\'e} socio-institutionnelle \guillemotright{} est une condition {\`a} la r{\'e}ussite de la gestion des communs comme celle-ci est une forme d'adaptation au changement climatique par le construit social de l'espace {\`a} partir de l'historicit{\'e} de la communaut{\'e} des Niominka qui habitent en majorit{\'e} cet espace.

  abstract = {Climate change is at the present time a new threat which leads to increased frequency and intensity of floods, droughts and cyclones with rising sea levels; thus placing additional demands on a situation already critical in rural areas.
In Senegal, as in many countries of the Sahel, those natural phenomena result in a significant drop in harvests, water shortages and worsening health crisis which leads to consequences such as growing food insecurity of the population; thus threatening the progress achieved in regards with the fight against poverty during the last century.
Indeed, many farmers live in rural areas which are characterized as low rainfall, saline soils, fragile or degraded soils and limited market access areas. The poverty in which they live, especially those of women, is often worsened by social exclusion. Such farmers are vulnerable because they depend directly on rainfall and seasons. They have little savings while supports from the government or their local authorities remain inadequate. It is essential to strengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable countries and communities to cope with the impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security.
This document is the result of a multi-criteria analysis of experiences of tackling climate variability, drought and desertification, and land degradation on one hand, and Adaptation to Climate Change in Senegal on the other. 

It is carried out on the initiative of the national platform for science-policy dialogue on adaptation of agriculture and food security to climate change (C-CASA) for capacity building and informed decision making for adaptation to climate change.
This work has received technical and financial support from CCAFS Program (www.ccafs.cgiar.org).
It is intended for the use of field workers in the area of adaptation to climate change. It also serves as technologies and tools guide to adapt to climate change impacts in the area of agriculture and food security.
The manual is based primarily on (1) both the institutional and peasant experiences of the actors; (2) the recommendations of the reports of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); (3) the procedures manual for assessing climate change impacts and adaptation strategies; (4) the results of development projects and applied research. 
This is a collection that comes as a complement to other initiatives in the country and ongoing operations which provide practical examples of using the technological options for successful implementation of projects and programs and for the definition of agricultural policies in the Sahel.},

  abstract = {Dans sa qu{\^e}te d'un acc{\`e}s universel {\`a} l'{\'e}lectricit{\'e}, le S{\'e}n{\'e}gal a mis en place un syst{\`e}me pionnier en mati{\`e}re d'{\'e}lectrification rurale par le biais de concessions d'{\'e}lectrification rurale (CER) et de projets d'{\'e}lectrification rurale d'initiative locale (ERIL). Si l'{\'e}lectrification rurale progresse depuis dix ans, les projets qui la portent rencontrent un probl{\`e}me de soutenabilit{\'e} qui entrave la r{\'e}alisation de l'objectif du pays d'atteindre un taux d'{\'e}lectrification de 100\% d'ici 2025.
En 2017, le taux d'{\'e}lectrification national {\'e}tait de 60\% contre 53\% en 2010. Le taux d'{\'e}lectrification dans les zones urbaines du S{\'e}n{\'e}gal atteignait d{\'e}j{\`a} 90\% en 2009 alors que, dans les zones rurales, il demeurait proche de 30\% en 2015, en raison des r{\'e}sultats d{\'e}cevants du plan d'action pour l'{\'e}lectrification rurale (PASER) qui reposait sur la cr{\'e}ation de 10 zones de concession d'{\'e}lectrification rurale {\`a} g{\'e}rer par le secteur priv{\'e}. Ce mod{\`e}le, bien qu'innovant et malgr{\'e} les promesses d{\'e}coulant de l'attribution de 6 zones de concession au d{\'e}part, a rencontr{\'e} de nombreuses difficult{\'e}s et obstacles.
L'objectif de cette {\'e}tude est donc d'analyser la pertinence de la politique {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique actuelle du S{\'e}n{\'e}gal au regard de ses ambitions d'acc{\`e}s universel {\`a} l'{\'e}lectricit{\'e} et des principaux d{\'e}fis auxquels le pays doit faire face, comme l'ind{\'e}pendance {\'e}nerg{\'e}tique et la s{\'e}curit{\'e} d'approvisionnement face {\`a} la croissance de la demande, le besoin d'investissement massif en infrastructures et le changement climatique.
Pour ce faire, l'{\'e}tude a {\'e}t{\'e} divis{\'e}e en 4 parties. La premi{\`e}re pr{\'e}sente un aper{\c c}u du pays, y compris de ses fondamentaux macro{\'e}conomiques.

These countries that share the water resources of the river are confronted with climatic hazards, at the origin of natural disasters such as floods and droughts. However, their degrees of exposure and capacities of adaptation to climate change are different. For decreasing the risk connected to the climate warming, several strategies of adaptation are implemented. In the Senegal River Basin, one focused on regional institutions like OMVS (Organization for the Development of Senegal River). The latter facilitated the collection and dissemination of regional information making possible the development of strategies for coordinated cooperation at regional level. OMVS provides a conceptual framework through which different developed policies, strategies and guidelines are necessary to achieve sustainable socio-economic development thanks to a rational use of water resources. The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the mechanisms by which today the sharing of information and knowledge on climate change takes place in the Senegal River Basin and how they are used within the implementation of adaptation strategies to climatic hazards.},
