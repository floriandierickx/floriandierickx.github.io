Herein we report a direct electrocatalytic process for highly selective ethylene production from CO reduction with water over Cu catalysts at room temperature and ambient pressure. An unprecedented 52.7 \% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene formation is achieved through optimization of cathode structure to facilitate CO diffusion at the surface of the electrode and Cu catalysts to enhance the C-C bond coupling. The highly selective ethylene production is almost without other carbon-based byproducts (e.g. C1\textendash{}C4 hydrocarbons and CO2) and avoids the drawbacks of the traditional Fischer\textendash{}Tropsch process that always delivers undesired products. This study provides a new and promising strategy for highly selective production of ethylene from the abundant industrial CO.},

  abstract = {The emergence of politically driven bioeconomy strategies worldwide calls for considering the ecological issues associated with bio-based products. Traditionally, life cycle analysis (LCA) approaches are key tools used to assess impacts through product life cycles, but they present limitations regarding the accounting of multiple ecosystem service-related issues, at both the land-use and supply chain levels. Based on a systematic review of empirical articles, this study provides insights on using LCA assessments to account for ecosystem service-related impacts in the context of bioeconomy activities. We address the following research questions: what is the state of the art of the literature performing LCA assessments of forest-based bioeconomy activities, including the temporal distribution, the geographic areas and products/processes at study, and the approaches and methods used? 2. Which impacts and related midpoints are considered by the reviewed studies and what types of ecosystem service- related information do they bear? Out of over 600 articles found through the Scopus search, 155 were deemed relevant for the review. The literature focuses on North-America and Europe. Most of the articles assessed the environmental impact of lower-value biomass uses. Climate change was assessed in over 90\% of the studies, while issues related to ozone, eutrophication, human toxicity, resource depletion, acidification, and environmental toxicity were assessed in 40\% to 60\% of the studies. While the impact categories accounted for in the reviewed LCA studies bear information relevant to certain provisioning and regulating services, several ecosystem services (especially cultural ones) remain unaccounted for. The implications of our study are relevant for professionals working in the ecosystem services, circular bioeconomy, and/or LCA communities.},

  abstract = {Plastic use has increased by twenty fold since the 1950s and so has the amount of plastic waste generated. Although legislation promotes reuse and recycling, still over 50\% of Europe's plastic waste is still disposed of into landfills. Therefore, millions of tonnes of plastic end up in the environment, provoking severe harm, wasting tonnes of resources (i.e. fossil fuels), and generating the need for advanced treatments, i.e. pyrolysis. Commonly, only a small amount of monomer (i.e. ethylene (C2H4)) and a large amount of waxy products, i.e. aliphatic hydrocarbons that require further refinement, are recovered by conventional pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Therefore, direct conversion of HDPE waste into high value added products would be more desirable. In this study, experiments were carried out using cold plasma assisted pyrolysis of waste HDPE for valorisation. With the assistance of cold plasma, up to 22\textendash{}25 wt\% ethylene was recovered from HDPE waste, up to 55 times higher than that obtained in conventional pyrolysis of waste HDPE. Catalytic cold plasma pyrolysis showed that the addition of only 3\textendash{}10 wt\% HZMS-5 or sulphated zirconia doubled the gas (up to 41 wt\%) and subsequently the ethylene yield at low temperatures. This study opens up opportunities to valorise unsorted waste into intermediates for chemical processes via a simple process.},

  abstract = {Approximately 50 million tons of lignin are currently produced annually as a by-product of the pulp- and paper industry, and this amount is likely to double in the future with the anticipated production of renewable fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass, as a sustainable alternative to petroleum. The latter process can be expedited by valorizing lignin, which entails making products from lignin that generate additional revenues for biorefineries so that the production of biofuels becomes more competitive with gasoline. Industrially produced lignin is considered a low-value material that is used as a boiler fuel to generate heat and electricity, and as an ingredient of adhesives, cement, and drilling fluids for underwater oil wells. The aromatic nature of lignin, its ability to participate in radical-mediated cross-linking reactions, the many functional groups available for derivatization or chemical reactions, and its amenability to existing procedures for making thermoplastics, make it attractive as an additive to polymers to enhance UV-tolerance and/or other physico-chemical properties. Lignin can also be used as the basis for various nanomaterials, either per se or in combination with other polymers. This review summarizes recent developments in the synthesis of lignin-containing polymers and nanomaterials, whereby inherent variation in lignin subunit composition and structure, as a function of plant species and lignin extraction method, offer unique opportunities for fine-tuning material properties (e.g. tensile strength, hardness, elasticity) to match specific applications. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Systems technologies emerge with a powerful potential to support the deployment and design of future biorefineries. The chemical industry experiences a steady growth in the use of renewables induced by the gradual depletion of oil, uncertainties in energy supplies and a commanding requirement to reduce GHG emissions and save the planet. Renewables introduce an impressive range of options with biorefining at the center of attention as an emerging industrial concept, uniquely attached to chemical engineering and aiming to transform plant-derived biomass into a variety of products including transport fuels, platform chemicals, polymers, and specialty chemicals. In competing with conventional processes, biorefineries should match maximum efficiencies with better design and process integration. The paper highlights the pivotal role of systems technology to foster innovation, preview options, and support high-throughput computational experimentation, arguing that systems tools are largely under-deployed. Systems-enabled platforms could instead function as powerful environments to generate ideas for integrated designs and offer tremendous services to the complex and large problems produced by the numerous portfolios of feedstocks, unknown portfolios of products, multiple chemistries, and multiple processing paths. Complexities certainly exceed capabilities of previous methodologies but established achievements and experience with similar problems are excellent starting points for future contributions. Besides a general discussion, the paper outlines opportunities for innovation in design, concept-level synthesis, process integration, and the development of supply chains.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, bio-succinic acid from renewable resources has gained increasing attention as a potential bio-derived platform chemical for the detergent/surfactant, ion chelator, food and pharmaceutical markets. Until now, much research was undertaken to lower the production costs of bio-succinic acid, however a multicriteria sustainability evaluation of established and upcoming production processes from a technical perspective is still lacking in the scientific literature. In this study, we combine metabolic engineering with the most mature technologies for the production of bio-succinic acid from sugar beet and lignocellulosic residues. Downstream technologies such as reactive extraction, electrodialysis and ion exchange are investigated together with different upstream technologies such as neutral pH level-, acidic- and high sugar fermentation including metabolically engineered E. coli strains. Different biorefinery concepts are evaluated considering technical, economic, environmental and process hazard aspects in order to gain a broad sustainability perspective of the technologies. The results reveal that energy integration is a key factor for biorefinery concepts in order to be economically reasonable and to achieve lower environmental impacts compared to the conventional production from non-renewable resources. It was found that metabolically engineered E. coli with resistance at the acidic pH level in the fermentation together with reactive extraction in the purification presents the most environmentally competitive technology. However, E. coli strains with resistance at high sugar concentrations together with reactive extraction are revealed to present the most economically competitive technology for the production of bio-succinic acid. Moreover, both technologies are flagged for higher process hazards and require the right measures to enhance process safety and mitigate environmental loads and worker exposure.},

  abstract = {Concerns over non-renewable fossil fuel supply and climate change have been driving the Renaissance of bio-based materials. To substantiate environmental claims, the impacts of bio-based materials are typically quantified by applying life cycle assessment (LCA). The internationally agreed LCA standards provide generic recommendations on how to evaluate the environmental impacts of products and services but do not address details that are specifically relevant for the life cycles of bio-based materials. Here, we provide an overview of key issues and methodologies explicitly pertinent to the LCA of bio-based materials. We argue that the treatment of biogenic carbon storage is critical for quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions of bio-based materials in comparison with petrochemical materials. We acknowledge that biogenic carbon storage remains controversial but recommend accounting for it, depending on product-specific life cycles and the likely time duration of carbon storage. If carbon storage is considered, co-product allocation is nontrivial and should be chosen with care in order to: (i) ensure that carbon storage is assigned to the main product and the co-product(s) in the intended manner and (ii) avoid double counting of stored carbon in the main product and once more in the co-product(s). Land-use change, soil degradation, water use, and impacts on soil carbon stocks and biodiversity are important aspects that have recently received attention. We explain various approaches to account for these and conclude that substantial methodological progress is necessary, which is however hampered by the complex and often case- and site-specific nature of impacts. With the exception of soil degradation, we recommend preliminary approaches for including these impacts in the LCA of bio-based materials. The use of attributional versus consequential LCA approaches is particularly relevant in the context of bio-based materials. We conclude that it is more challenging to prepare accurate consequential LCA studies, especially because these should account for future developments and secondary impacts around bio-based materials which are often difficult to anticipate and quantify. Although hampered by complexity and limited data availability, the application of the proposed approaches to the extent possible would allow obtaining a more comprehensive insight into the environmental impacts of the production, use, and disposal of bio-based materials.},

Statistics concerning employment in wood-based industries\&mdash;the main component of the forest-based bioeconomy\&mdash;must be processed carefully to cope with differences in definitions and estimation methods. In addition, specific methods must be applied to estimate wood-based employment in sectors including also non-wood activities. In this study, we first delineate the boundaries of the wood-based bioeconomy, and then create a harmonised time series on employment for the identified sectors. Finally, we estimate the share of wood-based employment along the value chain in all sectors using wood. According to the results, forestry and extended wood-based value chains employed 4.5 million people in the EU-28 in 2018. Employment in wood-based value chains decreased between 2008 and 2013 in the aftermaths of the financial crisis. Continuously decreasing employment\&mdash;most apparent in the manufacture of solid wood products and pulp and paper\&mdash;results from increasing productivity and a decreasing demand for graphic paper. Further, most of the wood-based employment in the EU takes place in downstream parts of value chains, although the weight of the primary sector is still high in some Eastern European countries.},

  abstract = {The demand for fossil derivate fuels and chemicals has increased, augmenting concerns on climate change, global economic stability, and sustainability on fossil resources. Therefore, the production of fuels and chemicals from alternative and renewable resources has attracted considerable and growing attention. Ethanol is a promising biofuel that can reduce the consumption of gasoline in the transportation sector and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock to produce bioethanol (cellulosic ethanol) because of its abundance and low cost. Since the conversion of lignocellulose to ethanol is complex and expensive, the cellulosic ethanol price cannot compete with those of the fossil derivate fuels. A promising strategy to lower the production cost of cellulosic ethanol is developing a biorefinery which produces ethanol and other high-value chemicals from lignocellulose. The selection of such chemicals is difficult because there are hundreds of products that can be produced from lignocellulose. Multiple reviews and reports have described a small group of lignocellulose derivate compounds that have the potential to be commercialized. Some of these products are in the bench scale and require extensive research and time before they can be industrially produced. This review examines chemicals and materials with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 8, which have reached a commercial scale and could be shortly or immediately integrated into a cellulosic ethanol process.},

Detailed spatial distribution maps of different crop residue potentials (theoretical, technical, environmental and sustainable) are provided at 1 km spatial resolution. The average theoretical potential was estimated at 291 and 367 Mt DM in the EU and Europe, respectively. Significant yearly variability of crop residue production has been noticed, between 209 and 365 million tonnes dry yr-1 (3673\textendash{}6389 PJ) in the EU and between 253 and 483 million tonnes dry yr-1 (4434\textendash{}8453 PJ) across Europe.

Herein, we demonstrate that mixtures of ILs are powerful systems for the selective catalytic transformation of cellulose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Combining ILs with continuous HMF extraction into methyl-isobutyl ketone or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which form a biphase with the IL mixture, allows the online separation of HMF in high yield. This one-step process is operated under relatively mild conditions and represents a significant step forward towards sustainable HMF production.},

group of aromatic biopolymers, i.e. the second most abundant class of biopolymers on Earth.
It accounts for approximately 30 \% of wood weight while conferring rigidity and
antimicrobial properties to wood. Since lignin is combined with cellulose and hemicellulose
in biomass, this will constitute a limiting factor in the bioconversion of wood into pulp or
second-generation biofuels through the biochemical pathway. These processes generate a
huge quantity of lignin as by-products, mainly used as fuels for energy savings. Recently,
alternative routes towards lignin's valorization were emphasized (e.g. as bio-based resins,
adhesives, or composites), but they strongly depend on lignin's chemical structure, also
dependent on fractionation process. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the strong
interplay between extraction processes, resource supply, and recent uses of lignin into biobased
materials.},

  abstract = {The catalytic valorization of lignin for the production of renewable chemicals has been discussed. The polymerization by random phenol radical-radical coupling reactions under chemical control leads to the formation of lignin vascular plants. The dominant linkage in both softwood and hardwood is the {$\beta$}-O-4 linkage, consisting of approximately 50\% of spruce linkages and 60\% of birch and eucalyptus linkages. The composition of softwood and hardwood lignin varies in the relative abundance of the p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. The additional methoxy groups on the aromatic rings prevent formation of 5-5 or dibenzodioxocin linkages, and thus cause the hardwood lignin polymer to form more linear structures relative to softwood. Several different lignin sources, derived from a specific form of biomass pretreatment, can be significantly used as feedstock for lignin valorization in a biorefinery.},
