  abstract = {Over the past few years, bio-succinic acid from renewable resources has gained increasing attention as a potential bio-derived platform chemical for the detergent/surfactant, ion chelator, food and pharmaceutical markets. Until now, much research was undertaken to lower the production costs of bio-succinic acid, however a multicriteria sustainability evaluation of established and upcoming production processes from a technical perspective is still lacking in the scientific literature. In this study, we combine metabolic engineering with the most mature technologies for the production of bio-succinic acid from sugar beet and lignocellulosic residues. Downstream technologies such as reactive extraction, electrodialysis and ion exchange are investigated together with different upstream technologies such as neutral pH level-, acidic- and high sugar fermentation including metabolically engineered E. coli strains. Different biorefinery concepts are evaluated considering technical, economic, environmental and process hazard aspects in order to gain a broad sustainability perspective of the technologies. The results reveal that energy integration is a key factor for biorefinery concepts in order to be economically reasonable and to achieve lower environmental impacts compared to the conventional production from non-renewable resources. It was found that metabolically engineered E. coli with resistance at the acidic pH level in the fermentation together with reactive extraction in the purification presents the most environmentally competitive technology. However, E. coli strains with resistance at high sugar concentrations together with reactive extraction are revealed to present the most economically competitive technology for the production of bio-succinic acid. Moreover, both technologies are flagged for higher process hazards and require the right measures to enhance process safety and mitigate environmental loads and worker exposure.},

  abstract = {Platform chemicals are usually derived from petrochemical feedstocks. A sustainable alternative commences with lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable feedstock, but one that is highly challenging to process. Ionic liquids (ILs) are able to solubilize biomass and, in the presence of catalysts, convert the biomass into useful platform chemicals. Herein, we demonstrate that mixtures of ILs are powerful systems for the selective catalytic transformation of cellulose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Combining ILs with continuous HMF extraction into methyl-isobutyl ketone or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which form a biphase with the IL mixture, allows the online separation of HMF in high yield. This one-step process is operated under relatively mild conditions and represents a significant step forward towards sustainable HMF production.},

The polymerization by random phenol radical-radical coupling reactions under chemical control leads to the formation of lignin vascular plants. The dominant linkage in both softwood and hardwood is the {$\beta$}-O-4 linkage, consisting of approximately 50\% of spruce linkages and 60\% of birch and eucalyptus linkages. The composition of softwood and hardwood lignin varies in the relative abundance of the p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. The additional methoxy groups on the aromatic rings prevent formation of 5-5 or dibenzodioxocin linkages, and thus cause the hardwood lignin polymer to form more linear structures relative to softwood. Several different lignin sources, derived from a specific form of biomass pretreatment, can be significantly used as feedstock for lignin valorization in a biorefinery.},

  abstract = {Approximately 50 million tons of lignin are currently produced annually as a by-product of the pulp- and paper industry, and this amount is likely to double in the future with the anticipated production of renewable fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass, as a sustainable alternative to petroleum. The latter process can be expedited by valorizing lignin, which entails making products from lignin that generate additional revenues for biorefineries so that the production of biofuels becomes more competitive with gasoline. Industrially produced lignin is considered a low-value material that is used as a boiler fuel to generate heat and electricity, and as an ingredient of adhesives, cement, and drilling fluids for underwater oil wells. The aromatic nature of lignin, its ability to participate in radical-mediated cross-linking reactions, the many functional groups available for derivatization or chemical reactions, and its amenability to existing procedures for making thermoplastics, make it attractive as an additive to polymers to enhance UV-tolerance and/or other physico-chemical properties. Lignin can also be used as the basis for various nanomaterials, either per se or in combination with other polymers. This review summarizes recent developments in the synthesis of lignin-containing polymers and nanomaterials, whereby inherent variation in lignin subunit composition and structure, as a function of plant species and lignin extraction method, offer unique opportunities for fine-tuning material properties (e.g. tensile strength, hardness, elasticity) to match specific applications. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  volume = {12},
  issn = {1754-6834},
  abstract = {The demand for fossil derivate fuels and chemicals has increased, augmenting concerns on climate change, global economic stability, and sustainability on fossil resources. Therefore, the production of fuels and chemicals from alternative and renewable resources has attracted considerable and growing attention. Ethanol is a promising biofuel that can reduce the consumption of gasoline in the transportation sector and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock to produce bioethanol (cellulosic ethanol) because of its abundance and low cost. Since the conversion of lignocellulose to ethanol is complex and expensive, the cellulosic ethanol price cannot compete with those of the fossil derivate fuels. A promising strategy to lower the production cost of cellulosic ethanol is developing a biorefinery which produces ethanol and other high-value chemicals from lignocellulose. The selection of such chemicals is difficult because there are hundreds of products that can be produced from lignocellulose. Multiple reviews and reports have described a small group of lignocellulose derivate compounds that have the potential to be commercialized. Some of these products are in the bench scale and require extensive research and time before they can be industrially produced. This review examines chemicals and materials with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 8, which have reached a commercial scale and could be shortly or immediately integrated into a cellulosic ethanol process.},

group of aromatic biopolymers, i.e. the second most abundant class of biopolymers on Earth.
It accounts for approximately 30 \% of wood weight while conferring rigidity and
antimicrobial properties to wood. Since lignin is combined with cellulose and hemicellulose
in biomass, this will constitute a limiting factor in the bioconversion of wood into pulp or
second-generation biofuels through the biochemical pathway. These processes generate a
huge quantity of lignin as by-products, mainly used as fuels for energy savings. Recently,
alternative routes towards lignin's valorization were emphasized (e.g. as bio-based resins,
adhesives, or composites), but they strongly depend on lignin's chemical structure, also
dependent on fractionation process. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the strong
interplay between extraction processes, resource supply, and recent uses of lignin into biobased
materials.},

  volume = {34},
  abstract = {Systems technologies emerge with a powerful potential to support the deployment and design of future biorefineries. The chemical industry experiences a steady growth in the use of renewables induced by the gradual depletion of oil, uncertainties in energy supplies and a commanding requirement to reduce GHG emissions and save the planet. Renewables introduce an impressive range of options with biorefining at the center of attention as an emerging industrial concept, uniquely attached to chemical engineering and aiming to transform plant-derived biomass into a variety of products including transport fuels, platform chemicals, polymers, and specialty chemicals. In competing with conventional processes, biorefineries should match maximum efficiencies with better design and process integration. The paper highlights the pivotal role of systems technology to foster innovation, preview options, and support high-throughput computational experimentation, arguing that systems tools are largely under-deployed. Systems-enabled platforms could instead function as powerful environments to generate ideas for integrated designs and offer tremendous services to the complex and large problems produced by the numerous portfolios of feedstocks, unknown portfolios of products, multiple chemistries, and multiple processing paths. Complexities certainly exceed capabilities of previous methodologies but established achievements and experience with similar problems are excellent starting points for future contributions. Besides a general discussion, the paper outlines opportunities for innovation in design, concept-level synthesis, process integration, and the development of supply chains.},

  title = {Monomer Recovery through Advanced Pyrolysis of Waste High Density Polyethylene ({{HDPE}})},
  volume = {20},
  issn = {1463-9270},
  abstract = {Plastic use has increased by twenty fold since the 1950s and so has the amount of plastic waste generated. Although legislation promotes reuse and recycling, still over 50\% of Europe's plastic waste is still disposed of into landfills. Therefore, millions of tonnes of plastic end up in the environment, provoking severe harm, wasting tonnes of resources (i.e. fossil fuels), and generating the need for advanced treatments, i.e. pyrolysis. Commonly, only a small amount of monomer (i.e. ethylene (C2H4)) and a large amount of waxy products, i.e. aliphatic hydrocarbons that require further refinement, are recovered by conventional pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Therefore, direct conversion of HDPE waste into high value added products would be more desirable. In this study, experiments were carried out using cold plasma assisted pyrolysis of waste HDPE for valorisation. With the assistance of cold plasma, up to 22\textendash{}25 wt\% ethylene was recovered from HDPE waste, up to 55 times higher than that obtained in conventional pyrolysis of waste HDPE. Catalytic cold plasma pyrolysis showed that the addition of only 3\textendash{}10 wt\% HZMS-5 or sulphated zirconia doubled the gas (up to 41 wt\%) and subsequently the ethylene yield at low temperatures. This study opens up opportunities to valorise unsorted waste into intermediates for chemical processes via a simple process.},
