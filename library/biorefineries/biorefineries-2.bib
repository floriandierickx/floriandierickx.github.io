  abstract = {The transport sector is fast changing with demand for distillates increasing amidst declining gasoline consumption in many markets especially in the developed world. Increasingly refineries are stretched to operate less efficiently and this is manifested through a drop in efficiency as a consequence of increasing diesel production via less efficient routes, particularly on the marginal barrel of diesel. It has been suggested that this decline in diesel production efficiency, as the ratio of gasoline to diesel (G/D) production drops, can partly be mitigated through the use of Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) diesel. In this paper we adopted refinery Linear-Programming models to represent the refining system in Europe as well as a district in the U.S. to investigate the effects of increased availability of GTL diesel to a refiner on the energy efficiency and GHG emissions of refineries. Here we showed that indeed there is an improvement in diesel production efficiency with increasing GTL concentrations, but this efficiency gain ({$<$}0.5\%) is insufficient to counteract the higher energy consumption and emissions associated with the production of GTL, thus leading to an overall decline in life cycle efficiency (up to 5\%), and an increase in life cycle GHG emissions (up to 2\%).},

Herein we report a direct electrocatalytic process for highly selective ethylene production from CO reduction with water over Cu catalysts at room temperature and ambient pressure. An unprecedented 52.7 \% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene formation is achieved through optimization of cathode structure to facilitate CO diffusion at the surface of the electrode and Cu catalysts to enhance the C-C bond coupling. The highly selective ethylene production is almost without other carbon-based byproducts (e.g. C1\textendash{}C4 hydrocarbons and CO2) and avoids the drawbacks of the traditional Fischer\textendash{}Tropsch process that always delivers undesired products. This study provides a new and promising strategy for highly selective production of ethylene from the abundant industrial CO.},

  abstract = {The emergence of politically driven bioeconomy strategies worldwide calls for considering the ecological issues associated with bio-based products. Traditionally, life cycle analysis (LCA) approaches are key tools used to assess impacts through product life cycles, but they present limitations regarding the accounting of multiple ecosystem service-related issues, at both the land-use and supply chain levels. Based on a systematic review of empirical articles, this study provides insights on using LCA assessments to account for ecosystem service-related impacts in the context of bioeconomy activities. We address the following research questions: what is the state of the art of the literature performing LCA assessments of forest-based bioeconomy activities, including the temporal distribution, the geographic areas and products/processes at study, and the approaches and methods used? 2. Which impacts and related midpoints are considered by the reviewed studies and what types of ecosystem service- related information do they bear? Out of over 600 articles found through the Scopus search, 155 were deemed relevant for the review. The literature focuses on North-America and Europe. Most of the articles assessed the environmental impact of lower-value biomass uses. Climate change was assessed in over 90\% of the studies, while issues related to ozone, eutrophication, human toxicity, resource depletion, acidification, and environmental toxicity were assessed in 40\% to 60\% of the studies. While the impact categories accounted for in the reviewed LCA studies bear information relevant to certain provisioning and regulating services, several ecosystem services (especially cultural ones) remain unaccounted for. The implications of our study are relevant for professionals working in the ecosystem services, circular bioeconomy, and/or LCA communities.},

A biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. Biorefineries combine the necessary technologies of the biorenewable raw materials with those of chemical intermediates and final products. Char production by pyrolysis, bio-oil production by pyrolysis, gaseous fuels from biomass, Fischer\textendash{}Tropsch liquids from biomass, hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass, supercritical liquefaction, and biochemical processes of biomass are studied and concluded in this review. Upgraded bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis can be used in vehicle engines as fuel.},

  abstract = {Plastic use has increased by twenty fold since the 1950s and so has the amount of plastic waste generated. Although legislation promotes reuse and recycling, still over 50\% of Europe's plastic waste is still disposed of into landfills. Therefore, millions of tonnes of plastic end up in the environment, provoking severe harm, wasting tonnes of resources (i.e. fossil fuels), and generating the need for advanced treatments, i.e. pyrolysis. Commonly, only a small amount of monomer (i.e. ethylene (C2H4)) and a large amount of waxy products, i.e. aliphatic hydrocarbons that require further refinement, are recovered by conventional pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Therefore, direct conversion of HDPE waste into high value added products would be more desirable. In this study, experiments were carried out using cold plasma assisted pyrolysis of waste HDPE for valorisation. With the assistance of cold plasma, up to 22\textendash{}25 wt\% ethylene was recovered from HDPE waste, up to 55 times higher than that obtained in conventional pyrolysis of waste HDPE. Catalytic cold plasma pyrolysis showed that the addition of only 3\textendash{}10 wt\% HZMS-5 or sulphated zirconia doubled the gas (up to 41 wt\%) and subsequently the ethylene yield at low temperatures. This study opens up opportunities to valorise unsorted waste into intermediates for chemical processes via a simple process.},

We present new measurements from the space-based TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) launched in 2017 that show methane enhancements over production regions in the United States. In the Uintah Basin in Utah, TROPOMI methane columns correlated with in-situ measurements, and the highest columns were observed over the deepest parts of the basin, consistent with the accumulation of emissions underneath inversions. In the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, methane columns showed maxima over regions with the highest natural gas production and were correlated with nitrogen-dioxide columns at a ratio that is consistent with results from in-situ airborne measurements. The improved detail provided by TROPOMI will likely enable the timely monitoring from space of methane emissions associated with oil and natural gas production.},

  abstract = {Approximately 50 million tons of lignin are currently produced annually as a by-product of the pulp- and paper industry, and this amount is likely to double in the future with the anticipated production of renewable fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass, as a sustainable alternative to petroleum. The latter process can be expedited by valorizing lignin, which entails making products from lignin that generate additional revenues for biorefineries so that the production of biofuels becomes more competitive with gasoline. Industrially produced lignin is considered a low-value material that is used as a boiler fuel to generate heat and electricity, and as an ingredient of adhesives, cement, and drilling fluids for underwater oil wells. The aromatic nature of lignin, its ability to participate in radical-mediated cross-linking reactions, the many functional groups available for derivatization or chemical reactions, and its amenability to existing procedures for making thermoplastics, make it attractive as an additive to polymers to enhance UV-tolerance and/or other physico-chemical properties. Lignin can also be used as the basis for various nanomaterials, either per se or in combination with other polymers. This review summarizes recent developments in the synthesis of lignin-containing polymers and nanomaterials, whereby inherent variation in lignin subunit composition and structure, as a function of plant species and lignin extraction method, offer unique opportunities for fine-tuning material properties (e.g. tensile strength, hardness, elasticity) to match specific applications. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Substantial further savings are possible for the future by improved fermentation and downstream processing. Worldwide CO2 savings in the range of 500-1000 million tons per year are possible using future technology. Industrial biotechnology hence offers excellent opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing dependence on fossil energy sources and therefore has the potential to make inroads into the existing chemical industry.},

The data system relies on existing energy consumption data sets and regional and country-specific inventories to produce trends over recent decades. All emission species are consistently estimated using the same activity data over all time periods. Emissions are provided on an annual basis at the level of country and sector and gridded with monthly seasonality. These estimates are comparable to, but generally slightly higher than, existing global inventories. Emissions over the most recent years are more uncertain, particularly in low- and middle-income regions where country-specific emission inventories are less available.

A more efficient use of the adjacent infrastructure, e.g., district heating networks, natural gas grids, neighbouring industries, and CO2 transport and storage systems, could provide opportunities for additional CO2 emissions reduction. It is shown that access to infrastructures that can facilitate CO2 abatement varies significantly across countries and between individual refineries. The assessment shows that short-term mitigation options, i.e., fuel substitution and energy efficiency measures, could reduce CO2 emissions by 9\textendash{}40 MtCO2/year (6\textendash{}26\% of the total refinery emissions). It is further shown that carbon capture and storage offers the greatest potential for more significant emission reductions in the longer term. However, the potential for CO2 capture varies significantly depending on the choice of technology, CO2 source, and scope of implementation (5\textendash{}80\% of the total refinery emissions).},

The BCI is the sum of the four FCIs. The Biorefinery Complexity Profile (BCP) is a compact format to present the complexity of a biorefinery by giving the BCI and the four FCIs of each feature.},

  abstract = {A key driver for the necessary sustainable development is the implementation of the BioEconomy, which is based on renewable resources to satisfy its energy and material demand of our society. The broad spectrum of biomass resources offers great opportunities for a comprehensive product portfolio to satisfy the different needs of a BioEconomy \textendash{} food, feed, bioenergy, biofuels, chemicals, materials. The concept of biorefining guarantees the resource and energy efficient use of biomass resources. The IEA Bioenergy Task 42 ``Biorefining'' has the following definition on biorefinery: ``Biorefining is the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, and materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat)''. Currently many different biorefinery concepts are developed and already implemented which play a key role in establishing a BioEconomy. The purpose of the work is to analyse the possible integration of biorefineries in the existing industrial infrastructure. This information assists industry, decision makers and investors in their strategies to invest and integrate resource efficient biomass uses in the infrastructure of a future BioEconomy. Based on the activities of the 11 participating countries (A, AUS, CA, DK, FR, G, I, J, NL, US) the IEA Task 42 identified and assessed the current status and development potential of ``energydriven'' biorefineries and ``product-driven'' biorefineries. The 14 most interesting ``energy-driven'' biorefinery concepts until 2025 and their value chains, including the integration and deployment options in industrial infrastructures, are analyzed. The classification and description of existing infrastructure in combination with the available biomass resources and (future) market needs shows the matching points for a cost and resource efficient roll out of the BioEconomy by implementing various biorefineries.},

  abstract = {Chemical production is set to become the single largest driver of global oil consumption by 2030. To reduce oil consumption and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon dioxide can be captured from stacks or air and utilized as alternative carbon source for chemicals. Here, we show that carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has the technical potential to decouple chemical production from fossil resources, reducing annual GHG emissions by up to 3.5 Gt CO2-eq in 2030. Exploiting this potential, however, requires more than 18.1 PWh of low-carbon electricity, corresponding to 55\% of the projected global electricity production in 2030. Most large-scale CCU technologies are found to be less efficient in reducing GHG emissions per unit low-carbon electricity when benchmarked to power-to-X efficiencies reported for other large-scale applications including electro-mobility (e-mobility) and heat pumps. Once and where these other demands are satisfied, CCU in the chemical industry could efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Systems technologies emerge with a powerful potential to support the deployment and design of future biorefineries. The chemical industry experiences a steady growth in the use of renewables induced by the gradual depletion of oil, uncertainties in energy supplies and a commanding requirement to reduce GHG emissions and save the planet. Renewables introduce an impressive range of options with biorefining at the center of attention as an emerging industrial concept, uniquely attached to chemical engineering and aiming to transform plant-derived biomass into a variety of products including transport fuels, platform chemicals, polymers, and specialty chemicals. In competing with conventional processes, biorefineries should match maximum efficiencies with better design and process integration. The paper highlights the pivotal role of systems technology to foster innovation, preview options, and support high-throughput computational experimentation, arguing that systems tools are largely under-deployed. Systems-enabled platforms could instead function as powerful environments to generate ideas for integrated designs and offer tremendous services to the complex and large problems produced by the numerous portfolios of feedstocks, unknown portfolios of products, multiple chemistries, and multiple processing paths. Complexities certainly exceed capabilities of previous methodologies but established achievements and experience with similar problems are excellent starting points for future contributions. Besides a general discussion, the paper outlines opportunities for innovation in design, concept-level synthesis, process integration, and the development of supply chains.},

To meet these targets, technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) must be part of the economic set of decarbonisation options for industry. A systematic review of the literature has been carried out on four of the largest industrial sectors (the iron and steel industry, the cement industry, the petroleum refining industry and the pulp and paper industry) as well as selected high-purity sources of CO2 from other industries to assess the applicability of different CCS technologies. Costing data have been gathered, and for the cement, iron and steel and refining industries, these data are used in a model to project costs per tonne of CO2 avoided over the time period extending from first deployment until 2050. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the model to assess which variables had the greatest impact on the overall cost of wide-scale CCS deployment for future better targeting of cost reduction measures. The factors found to have the greatest overall impact were the initial cost of CCS at the start of deployment and the start date at which large scale deployment is started, whilst a slower initial deployment rate after the start date also leads to significantly increased costs.},

Until now, much research was undertaken to lower the production costs of bio-succinic acid, however a multicriteria sustainability evaluation of established and upcoming production processes from a technical perspective is still lacking in the scientific literature. In this study, we combine metabolic engineering with the most mature technologies for the production of bio-succinic acid from sugar beet and lignocellulosic residues. Downstream technologies such as reactive extraction, electrodialysis and ion exchange are investigated together with different upstream technologies such as neutral pH level-, acidic- and high sugar fermentation including metabolically engineered E. coli strains. Different biorefinery concepts are evaluated considering technical, economic, environmental and process hazard aspects in order to gain a broad sustainability perspective of the technologies. The results reveal that energy integration is a key factor for biorefinery concepts in order to be economically reasonable and to achieve lower environmental impacts compared to the conventional production from non-renewable resources. It was found that metabolically engineered E. coli with resistance at the acidic pH level in the fermentation together with reactive extraction in the purification presents the most environmentally competitive technology. However, E. coli strains with resistance at high sugar concentrations together with reactive extraction are revealed to present the most economically competitive technology for the production of bio-succinic acid. Moreover, both technologies are flagged for higher process hazards and require the right measures to enhance process safety and mitigate environmental loads and worker exposure.},

  abstract = {Methane emissions due to accidents in the oil and natural gas sector are very challenging to monitor, and hence are seldom considered in emission inventories and reporting. One of the main reasons is the lack of measurements during such events. Here we report the detection of large methane emissions from a gas well blowout in Ohio during February to March 2018 in the total column methane measurements from the spaceborne Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). From these data, we derive a methane emission rate of 120 {$\pm$} 32 metric tons per hour. This hourly emission rate is twice that of the widely reported Aliso Canyon event in California in 2015. Assuming the detected emission represents the average rate for the 20-d blowout period, we find the total methane emission from the well blowout is comparable to one-quarter of the entire state of Ohio's reported annual oil and natural gas methane emission, or, alternatively, a substantial fraction of the annual anthropogenic methane emissions from several European countries. Our work demonstrates the strength and effectiveness of routine satellite measurements in detecting and quantifying greenhouse gas emission from unpredictable events. In this specific case, the magnitude of a relatively unknown yet extremely large accidental leakage was revealed using measurements of TROPOMI in its routine global survey, providing quantitative assessment of associated methane emissions.},

  abstract = {Concerns over non-renewable fossil fuel supply and climate change have been driving the Renaissance of bio-based materials. To substantiate environmental claims, the impacts of bio-based materials are typically quantified by applying life cycle assessment (LCA). The internationally agreed LCA standards provide generic recommendations on how to evaluate the environmental impacts of products and services but do not address details that are specifically relevant for the life cycles of bio-based materials. Here, we provide an overview of key issues and methodologies explicitly pertinent to the LCA of bio-based materials. We argue that the treatment of biogenic carbon storage is critical for quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions of bio-based materials in comparison with petrochemical materials. We acknowledge that biogenic carbon storage remains controversial but recommend accounting for it, depending on product-specific life cycles and the likely time duration of carbon storage. If carbon storage is considered, co-product allocation is nontrivial and should be chosen with care in order to: (i) ensure that carbon storage is assigned to the main product and the co-product(s) in the intended manner and (ii) avoid double counting of stored carbon in the main product and once more in the co-product(s). Land-use change, soil degradation, water use, and impacts on soil carbon stocks and biodiversity are important aspects that have recently received attention. We explain various approaches to account for these and conclude that substantial methodological progress is necessary, which is however hampered by the complex and often case- and site-specific nature of impacts. With the exception of soil degradation, we recommend preliminary approaches for including these impacts in the LCA of bio-based materials. The use of attributional versus consequential LCA approaches is particularly relevant in the context of bio-based materials. We conclude that it is more challenging to prepare accurate consequential LCA studies, especially because these should account for future developments and secondary impacts around bio-based materials which are often difficult to anticipate and quantify. Although hampered by complexity and limited data availability, the application of the proposed approaches to the extent possible would allow obtaining a more comprehensive insight into the environmental impacts of the production, use, and disposal of bio-based materials.},

Statistics concerning employment in wood-based industries\&mdash;the main component of the forest-based bioeconomy\&mdash;must be processed carefully to cope with differences in definitions and estimation methods. In addition, specific methods must be applied to estimate wood-based employment in sectors including also non-wood activities. In this study, we first delineate the boundaries of the wood-based bioeconomy, and then create a harmonised time series on employment for the identified sectors. Finally, we estimate the share of wood-based employment along the value chain in all sectors using wood. According to the results, forestry and extended wood-based value chains employed 4.5 million people in the EU-28 in 2018. Employment in wood-based value chains decreased between 2008 and 2013 in the aftermaths of the financial crisis. Continuously decreasing employment\&mdash;most apparent in the manufacture of solid wood products and pulp and paper\&mdash;results from increasing productivity and a decreasing demand for graphic paper. Further, most of the wood-based employment in the EU takes place in downstream parts of value chains, although the weight of the primary sector is still high in some Eastern European countries.},

  abstract = {The demand for fossil derivate fuels and chemicals has increased, augmenting concerns on climate change, global economic stability, and sustainability on fossil resources. Therefore, the production of fuels and chemicals from alternative and renewable resources has attracted considerable and growing attention. Ethanol is a promising biofuel that can reduce the consumption of gasoline in the transportation sector and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock to produce bioethanol (cellulosic ethanol) because of its abundance and low cost. Since the conversion of lignocellulose to ethanol is complex and expensive, the cellulosic ethanol price cannot compete with those of the fossil derivate fuels. A promising strategy to lower the production cost of cellulosic ethanol is developing a biorefinery which produces ethanol and other high-value chemicals from lignocellulose. The selection of such chemicals is difficult because there are hundreds of products that can be produced from lignocellulose. Multiple reviews and reports have described a small group of lignocellulose derivate compounds that have the potential to be commercialized. Some of these products are in the bench scale and require extensive research and time before they can be industrially produced. This review examines chemicals and materials with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 8, which have reached a commercial scale and could be shortly or immediately integrated into a cellulosic ethanol process.},

Detailed spatial distribution maps of different crop residue potentials (theoretical, technical, environmental and sustainable) are provided at 1 km spatial resolution. The average theoretical potential was estimated at 291 and 367 Mt DM in the EU and Europe, respectively. Significant yearly variability of crop residue production has been noticed, between 209 and 365 million tonnes dry yr-1 (3673\textendash{}6389 PJ) in the EU and between 253 and 483 million tonnes dry yr-1 (4434\textendash{}8453 PJ) across Europe. The average technical potential of crop residue was estimated at 168 million tonnes dry yr-1 (2941 PJ) in the EU and at 212 million tonnes dry yr-1 (3715 PJ) in Europe. The average sustainable potential considering both technical and environmental constraints in each location was estimated at about 124 million tonnes dry yr-1 (2162 PJ) in the EU and at 14 Mt DM (2601 PJ) in Europe.},

A sustainable alternative commences with lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable feedstock, but one that is highly challenging to process.

Herein, we demonstrate that mixtures of ILs are powerful systems for the selective catalytic transformation of cellulose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Combining ILs with continuous HMF extraction into methyl-isobutyl ketone or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which form a biphase with the IL mixture, allows the online separation of HMF in high yield. This one-step process is operated under relatively mild conditions and represents a significant step forward towards sustainable HMF production.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture is a radical way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally to mitigate the effects of climate change when CO2 is stored permanently or utilized sustainably. Modern oil refineries are large stationary emitters, that are accountable of notable share of heavy industry greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
Objectives for this master's thesis are to update information regarding the carbon capture, study CO2 sources at oil refineries, introduce potential capture technologies and their sustainability assessments. The goal of the life cycle assessment is to determine the carbon footprint and emission profile of selected technologies and compare their effectiveness to capture CO2 based on their own environmental impacts. In the empirical part, a life cycle assessment is conducted for CO2 capture from the hydrogen production. Amine absorption was selected as a base technology and physical absorption and fixed bed adsorption as comparable technologies, that are applied to stream after hydrogen production. Life cycle assessment results show that carbon footprints of the compared technologies are smaller than amine absorption.  
 
CO2 capture could be applied to CO2 concentrated refinery streams and it may become a necessity in the near future. However, incentives, regulatory and political framework are needed for wide scale adoption.},

  abstract = {Plastics represent a serious waste-handling problem, with only 10\% of the plastic waste (PW) generated world-wide being recycled. The remainder follows a linear economy model, involving disposal or incineration. Thermochemical recycling provides an opportunity to close the material cycle, and this work shows how this can be achieved using the existing petrochemical infrastructure. The transformation of a generic petrochemical cluster based on virgin fossil feedstocks into a cluster that is based on PW has the following proposed sequence: (1) the feedstock is partially replaced (45\% on carbon basis) by PW; (2) the feedstock is totally replaced by PW; (3) the process undergoes electrification; and (4) oxy-combustion and carbon capture and storage are introduced to achieve 100\% carbon recovery in the form of monomers or permanent storage. An alternative transformation pathway that includes the introduction of biomass is also considered. The energy and carbon balances of the proposed implementation steps are resolved, and cost estimates of the savings related to the feedstock and required investments are presented. The main conclusion drawn is that switching the feedstock from virgin fossil fuels to PW (Implementation steps 1 and 2) confers economic advantages. However, the subsequent transformation steps (Implementation steps 3 and 4) can only be justified if a value is assigned to the environmental benefits, e.g., CO2 savings, increased share of biogenic carbon in plastic products, increasing recycling quotas, and/or the potential of the process to compensate for the intermittency of renewable power. It is also discussed how utilisation of the diverse compositions of PW streams by additional processes can meet the other demands of a chemical cluster.},

  abstract = {Wood is the main source of lignin in the world. This generic term ``Lignin'' describes a large
group of aromatic biopolymers, i.e. the second most abundant class of biopolymers on Earth.
It accounts for approximately 30 \% of wood weight while conferring rigidity and
antimicrobial properties to wood. Since lignin is combined with cellulose and hemicellulose
in biomass, this will constitute a limiting factor in the bioconversion of wood into pulp or
second-generation biofuels through the biochemical pathway. These processes generate a
huge quantity of lignin as by-products, mainly used as fuels for energy savings. Recently,
alternative routes towards lignin's valorization were emphasized (e.g. as bio-based resins,
adhesives, or composites), but they strongly depend on lignin's chemical structure, also
dependent on fractionation process. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the strong
interplay between extraction processes, resource supply, and recent uses of lignin into biobased
materials.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture (CC) technology is receiving increasing attention as a critical technology for climate change mitigation. Most previous studies focus on the application of CC technology in the power generation sector, while fewer studies have analyzed applications in the refining industry, which is one of the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sources in the U.S. industrial sector. Unlike the power generation sector, the refining industry has highly distributed CO2 emission sources. In this paper, bottom-up modeling and techno-economic analysis approaches are integrated to quantify the national CO2 emission reduction potential and costs of three types of CC technologies applied to U.S. refineries: (1) pre-combustion, (2) post-combustion, and (3) oxyfuel-combustion. Two scenarios are developed to compare different design strategies for CC systems; one is a distributed design scenario for post-combustion technology, the other is a centralized design scenario for pre-combustion and oxyfuel-combustion technology. The results of the two scenarios are compared, and the trade-offs between different design strategies are highlighted. The results shown in this study provide an intuitive and quantitative understanding of the potential of CC technology to reduce CO2 emissions from the U.S. refining industry. Such information is helpful to policymakers, oil companies, and energy/environmental analysts for strategic planning and systems design to manage future CO2 emissions of refineries.},

  abstract = {The catalytic valorization of lignin for the production of renewable chemicals has been discussed. The polymerization by random phenol radical-radical coupling reactions under chemical control leads to the formation of lignin vascular plants. The dominant linkage in both softwood and hardwood is the {$\beta$}-O-4 linkage, consisting of approximately 50\% of spruce linkages and 60\% of birch and eucalyptus linkages. The composition of softwood and hardwood lignin varies in the relative abundance of the p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. The additional methoxy groups on the aromatic rings prevent formation of 5-5 or dibenzodioxocin linkages, and thus cause the hardwood lignin polymer to form more linear structures relative to softwood. Several different lignin sources, derived from a specific form of biomass pretreatment, can be significantly used as feedstock for lignin valorization in a biorefinery.},
