  abstract = {Personal input to the review of the European Investment Bank Climate and Energy Framework. It replies to requests for input on [1] additional dimensions to include in the long-term strategy, [2] strategical areas where the EIB could improve and [3] where the EIB should focus its support on in terms of energy investments and technology. The input consists of: [1] An argumentation to consider open-source and ambitious technologically-based research on feasibility of 100 \% renewables and decarbonisation, shortcomings of carbon pricing and carbon markets (EU ETS) as a sole tool to tackle decarbonisation and argumentation to take into account cross-border flows (both material and energy) in a solid methodological framework. [2] A summary and contribution for input by Bjarne Steffen from ETH on private vs. multilateral bank investment flows related to climate and energy projects, and the importance of EIB's role in convincing local governments to opt for low-carbon technologies and building capacity. [3] A collected bibliography to consider recent research on 100 \% renewables and Global Grid studies and academic articles and NGO reports on the functioning and shortcomings of the EU ETS System.
