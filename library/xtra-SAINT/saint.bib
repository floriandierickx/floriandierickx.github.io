  abstract = {Gas and power networks are tightly coupled and interact with each other due to physically interconnected facilities. In an integrated gas and power network, a contingency observed in one system may cause iterative cascading failures, resulting in network wide disruptions. Therefore, understanding the impacts of the interactions in both systems is crucial for governments, system operators, regulators and operational planners, particularly, to ensure security of supply for the overall energy system. Although simulation has been widely used in the assessment of gas systems as well as power systems, there is a significant gap in simulation models that are able to address the coupling of both systems. In this paper, a simulation framework that models and simulates the gas and power network in an integrated manner is proposed. The framework consists of a transient model for the gas system and a steady state model for the power system based on AC-Optimal Power Flow. The gas and power system model are coupled through an interface which uses the coupling equations to establish the data exchange and coordination between the individual models. The bidirectional interlink between both systems considered in this studies are the fuel gas offtake of gas fired power plants for power generation and the power supply to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and electric drivers installed in gas compressor stations and underground gas storage facilities. The simulation framework is implemented into an innovative simulation tool named SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems) and the capabilities of the tool are demonstrated by performing a contingency analysis for a real world example. Results indicate how a disruption triggered in one system propagates to the other system and affects the operation of critical facilities. In addition, the studies show the importance of using transient gas models for security of supply studies instead of successions of steady state models, where the time evolution of the line pack is not captured correctly.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an integrated transient hydraulic model that describes the dynamic behavior of natural gas transport systems (GTS). The model includes sub models of the most important facilities comprising a GTS, such as pipelines, compressor stations, pressure reduction stations, underground gas storage facilities and LNG Terminals. The submodels are combined to an integrated network model and the algorithm for solving the resulting system of equations is detailed. The accuracy of the model is confirmed by benchmarking the model against results from the scientific literature and the commercial software SIMONE. Finally, the ability of the model to simulate the normal operation of a real world gas system and the operation in case of a supply disruption from a major entry point is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources into existing electric power systems is connected with an increased interdependence between natural gas and electricity transmission networks. To analyse this interdependence and its impact on security of supply, we developed a novel quasi-dynamic simulation model and implemented it into the simulation tool SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems), the first published software application that allows the combined simulation of gas and electric power systems in a single time frame and simulation environment. The model is composed of a transient hydraulic simulation model for the gas system and an augmented AC-Optimal Power Flow model for the electric power system, which includes a model for dispatchable power system loads and considers time transitional constraints, such as the ramp rate and the start-up time of generation units. Both models take into account the control and constraints of the most relevant facilities present in both systems. The bidirectional interconnection between both systems is considered and established by coupling equations describing the fuel gas offtake for power generation in gas fired power plants, and the electric power supply to LNG terminals and electric driven compressors in gas compressor stations. The resulting system of equations for the combined model are solved in a single simulation time frame. In order to quantify the impact of different contingencies on the operation of the combined system, a number of security of supply parameters are proposed, which can be utilised to compare the impact of different contingencies on security of supply and the effectiveness of countermeasures to mitigate this impact. The capabilities of the combined model and the functionality of the simulation tool SAInt are demonstrated in a case study of a sample gas and power transmission system. Results indicate how the combined simulation of gas and electric power systems can give insight into important and critical information, such as the timing and propagation of contingencies cascading from one system to the other or the grace period to react to these contingencies. Such information can contribute to improving the coordination between gas and power transmission system operators in the event of a disruption, thus, increasing the resilience and the level of security of supply in the combined energy system. The information provided by the combined model cannot be obtained by the traditional co-simulation approach, where both systems are solved in different time frames. Furthermore, the studies stress the importance of using transient gas simulation models for security of supply analysis instead of steady state models, where the time evolution of gas pressure and linepack are not reflected appropriately.},

  abstract = {The operations of electricity and natural gas transmission networks in the U.S. are increasingly interdependent, due to the growing number of installations of gas fired generators and the penetration of renewable energy sources. This development suggests the need for closer communication and coordination between gas and power transmission system operators in order to improve the efficiency and reliability of the combined energy system. In this paper, we present a co-simulation platform for examining the interdependence between natural gas and electricity transmission networks based on a direct current unit-commitment and economic dispatch model for the power system and a transient hydraulic gas model for the gas system. We analyze the value of day-ahead coordination of power and natural gas network operations and show the importance of considering gas system constraints when analyzing power systems operation with high penetration of gas generators and renewable energy sources. Results show that day-ahead coordination contributes to a reduction in curtailed gas during high stress periods (e.g., large gas offtake ramps) and a reduction in energy consumption of gas compressor stations.},
